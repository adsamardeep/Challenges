# 🏷 Minimum column deletions using longest non-decreasing column subsequence

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an array of equal-length strings `strs`, determine the minimum number of columns to delete so that the remaining columns make the rows lexicographically sorted. You may delete any columns, but the relative order of remaining columns must be preserved.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
strs = ["babca", "bbazb"]
````

**Output:**

```python
3
```

**Explanation:**
The longest sequence of columns that keeps all rows non-decreasing is of length `2`, so `5 - 2 = 3` columns must be deleted.

## 🧠 Approach

1. Treat each column as an element in a sequence.
2. Define `dp[i]` as the length of the longest valid (non-decreasing across all rows) column subsequence ending at column `i`.
3. For each pair of columns `(j, i)` with `j < i`, check whether column `j` can precede column `i`:

   * This is valid if **for every row**, `row[j] <= row[i]`.
4. If valid, update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
5. The maximum value in `dp` represents the largest number of columns we can keep.
6. The answer is the total number of columns minus this maximum.

This is effectively a longest increasing (non-decreasing) subsequence problem generalized across multiple strings.

## 💻 Code 

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        m = len(strs[0])
        # dp[i] stores the max length of an increasing subsequence ending at index i
        dp = [1] * m
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(i):
                # Check if column j can precede column i for ALL rows
                # We use a generator expression with all() for clean syntax
                if all(row[j] <= row[i] for row in strs):
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
        # Result is total columns - max columns we can keep
        return m - max(dp)
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity: **O(m² · n)**, where `m` is the number of columns and `n` is the number of rows (strings).
* Space complexity: **O(m)** for the DP array.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Single string → result is `0` (already sorted).
* Single column → result is `0`.
* All columns already valid → `max(dp) = m`, so result `0`.
* All columns strictly decreasing → only one column can be kept, result `m - 1`.
* Rows with identical characters → columns are always compatible.
