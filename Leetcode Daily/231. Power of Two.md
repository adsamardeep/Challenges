# 💡 Problem: Check if a Number is a Power of Two

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, determine if it is a power of two.  
A number is a power of two if it can be written as:

\[
n = 2^x \quad \text{where } x \geq 0
\]

Return `True` if `n` is a power of two, otherwise `False`.

## 🔍 Example 1
**Input**
```
n = 16
```
**Output**
```
True
```
**Explanation**
```
16 = 2^4
```

---

## 🔍 Example 2
**Input**
```
n = 3
```
**Output**
```
False
```
**Explanation**
```
No integer x exists such that 2^x = 3
```

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Check Positivity**  
   - Powers of two are strictly positive, so `n <= 0` should return `False`.

2. **Bitwise Trick**  
   - In binary, a power of two has exactly **one** bit set to `1`.
   - Example:
     - `1` → `0001`
     - `2` → `0010`
     - `4` → `0100`
   - Subtracting `1` from a power of two flips all bits after that `1` bit, ensuring no overlap.
   - Therefore:
     ```
     n & (n - 1) == 0
     ```
     is only true when `n` is a power of two.

## 💻 Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and not (n & (n - 1))
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) → Constant-time operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) → No extra memory usage.

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- `n = 0` → False (0 is not a power of two)
- Negative numbers → False
- Large integers → Works correctly within Python’s limits
