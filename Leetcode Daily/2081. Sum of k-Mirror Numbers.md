# K-Mirror Numbers

## 🧩 Problem Description

A **k-mirror number** is a number that is:

1. A **palindrome in base 10**, and  
2. Also a **palindrome in base `k`**.

Given integers `k` and `n`, return the **sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers**.

### Example
```python
Input: k = 2, n = 5  
Output: 25  
Explanation: The first 5 numbers that are palindromic in both base-10 and base-2 are:
1 (1), 3 (11), 5 (101), 7 (111), 9 (1001) → Sum = 25
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def kMirror(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
        def is_base_k_palindrome(num: int, k: int) -> bool:
            # Convert num to base-k and check if it's a palindrome
            original = num
            reversed_num = 0
            while num > 0:
                reversed_num = reversed_num * k + num % k
                num //= k
            return original == reversed_num

        def create_palindrome(half: int, odd: bool) -> int:
            # Create full decimal palindrome from its half
            pal = half
            if odd:
                half //= 10  # Drop the last digit for odd-length palindromes
            while half > 0:
                pal = pal * 10 + half % 10
                half //= 10
            return pal

        sum_ = 0      # Total sum of valid k-mirror numbers
        found = 0     # Number of k-mirror numbers found
        length = 1    # Current length of palindrome

        while found < n:
            start = 10 ** ((length - 1) // 2)
            end = 10 ** ((length + 1) // 2)

            for half in range(start, end):
                pal = create_palindrome(half, length % 2 == 1)
                if is_base_k_palindrome(pal, k):
                    sum_ += pal
                    found += 1
                    if found == n:
                        return sum_
            length += 1

        return sum_
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  Approximately \( O(n \cdot \log N) \), where \( N \) is the size of palindromic numbers being checked. Efficiency comes from generating only palindromic base-10 numbers.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \) — constant extra space used, no storage of full result list.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The algorithm **generates base-10 palindromes only** and checks if they are also palindromes in base-`k`.
- This is more efficient than checking every number.
- Two helper functions are used:
  - `create_palindrome` constructs palindromes by mirroring digits.
  - `is_base_k_palindrome` converts and checks palindromicity in base-`k`.
