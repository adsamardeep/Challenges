# Difference of Sums of Multiples

## Problem Description

Given two integers `n` and `m`, compute the difference between:

- The sum of all integers from `1` to `n`, and
- **Twice** the sum of all integers between `1` and `n` that are divisible by `m`.

Return the result of:  
```
total_sum(1 to n) - 2 * sum_of_multiples(1 to n, divisible by m)
```

### Example:

```
Input: n = 10, m = 3  
Output: 19

Explanation:
- Sum of numbers from 1 to 10 = 55
- Numbers divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9 → sum = 18
- Result = 55 - 2 × 18 = 19
```

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        divisible_count = n // m
        divisible_sum = m * divisible_count * (divisible_count + 1) // 2
        return total_sum - 2 * divisible_sum
```

## Notes

- `total_sum` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- `divisible_sum` uses the arithmetic series formula for the numbers divisible by `m`.
- Time Complexity: **O(1)** (constant time).
- Space Complexity: **O(1)**.

This is an efficient mathematical approach that avoids iteration.
