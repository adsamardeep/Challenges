# 🏷 Minimum Time to Visit All Points

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a list of points on a 2D plane, where each point is represented as `[x, y]`.  
Starting from the first point, you must visit all points in the given order.

In one second, you can:
- Move vertically by 1 unit
- Move horizontally by 1 unit
- Move diagonally by 1 unit (both x and y change by 1)

Return the **minimum time** required to visit all the points.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
points = [[1,1], [3,4], [-1,0]]
````

**Output:**

```python
7
```

**Explanation:**

* From (1,1) → (3,4): max(|3−1|, |4−1|) = 3
* From (3,4) → (-1,0): max(|-1−3|, |0−4|) = 4
* Total time = 3 + 4 = 7

## 🧠 Approach

* The optimal movement between two points uses **diagonal moves as much as possible**.
* Each diagonal move reduces both x and y distance by 1.
* The minimum time between two points is therefore:

  ```
  max(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|)
  ```

### Steps:

1. Iterate through consecutive point pairs.
2. For each pair, compute the Chebyshev distance.
3. Accumulate the total time.

## 💻 Code 
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            ans += max(
                abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]),
                abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1])
            )
        return ans
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of points
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (constant extra space)

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Only one point → time required is `0`
* Points aligned horizontally or vertically
* Points requiring only diagonal movement
* Negative coordinates
