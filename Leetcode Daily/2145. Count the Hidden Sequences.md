# 📊 Number of Valid Arrays Based on Differences

## 🧩 Problem Description

Given a list of integers `differences`, where each element represents the difference between consecutive elements of an unknown integer array `arr`, and given two integers `lower` and `upper`, return the number of possible arrays that can be formed such that:

- The array's first element can be any integer.
- The rest of the array follows the given `differences` (i.e., `arr[i+1] - arr[i] == differences[i]`).
- Every element in the final array is within the inclusive range `[lower, upper]`.

The task is to determine how many such valid arrays can exist.

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
from itertools import accumulate
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numberOfArrays(self, differences: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        pfs = list(accumulate(differences, initial=0))
        return max(0, upper - lower - max(pfs) + min(pfs) + 1)
