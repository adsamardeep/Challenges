# Smallest Equivalent String

## Problem Description

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, representing equivalency relationships between characters. For each `i`, the characters `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are considered **equivalent**. This equivalence is **transitive**, i.e., if `a ~ b` and `b ~ c`, then `a ~ c`.

Given a `baseStr`, your task is to transform it by replacing each character with the **lexicographically smallest character** in its equivalence class. If a character does not belong to any equivalence class, it remains unchanged.

### Example

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "cde", baseStr = "eed"  
Output: "aad"

### Explanation

From `s1` and `s2`:
- 'a' ~ 'c'
- 'b' ~ 'd'
- 'c' ~ 'e'

The equivalence classes:
- {a, c, e}
- {b, d}

Smallest representatives:
- 'a' for {a, c, e}
- 'b' for {b, d}

Transforming `"eed"` gives `"aad"`.

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def smallestEquivalentString(self, s1, s2, baseStr):
        """
        :type s1: str
        :type s2: str
        :type baseStr: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        adj = defaultdict(list)

        # Step 1: Build the graph
        for a, b in zip(s1, s2):
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)

        def dfs(ch, visited):
            visited.add(ch)
            min_ch = ch
            for nei in adj[ch]:
                if nei not in visited:
                    candidate = dfs(nei, visited)
                    min_ch = min(min_ch, candidate)
            return min_ch

        result = []
        for ch in baseStr:
            visited = set()
            result.append(dfs(ch, visited))
        
        return ''.join(result)
```

## How It Works

- A graph is constructed where each character points to its equivalent characters.
- For each character in `baseStr`, a DFS is used to find the lexicographically smallest character in its equivalence class.
- The character is replaced with the smallest representative in its class.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N × K), where `N` is the length of `baseStr` and `K` is the size of the equivalence class (in worst case, up to 26).
- **Space Complexity**: O(26²) for graph representation and visited sets.

## Possible Optimization

This implementation uses DFS and is simple to understand, but can be improved in performance using **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** to avoid redundant graph traversals.
