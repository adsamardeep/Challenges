# Find Lucky Integer in an Array

This project provides a Python solution to the problem of finding the largest "lucky" integer in an array.

## Problem Description

A **lucky integer** is an integer whose **frequency** in the array is **equal to its value**.  
You are given an array of integers, and your task is to return the **largest lucky integer** in the array.  
If no lucky integer exists, return `-1`.

## Solution

The solution uses Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each number and then iterates through the counts to find the largest lucky number.

### Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: list[int]) -> int:
        from collections import Counter

        freq = Counter(arr)
        lucky = -1

        for num, count in freq.items():
            if num == count:
                lucky = max(lucky, num)

        return lucky
