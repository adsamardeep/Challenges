# Magical Sum with Bitwise Odd-Count Constraint

üìú **Problem Statement**  
Count the number of ways to pick a total of `total_count` items from a collection of categories `numbers` (you may pick 0..`total_count` items from each category), where each way contributes a multiplicative weight equal to the product of `numbers[i]**(count_i)`. In addition, when you add up the chosen counts `count_0 + count_1 + ...` in binary, the total number of `1` bits in that binary sum must equal `target_odd`. Return the count of valid weighted selections modulo `10**9 + 7`.

Put another way: for nonnegative integers `count_i` with `sum count_i = total_count`, the selection weight is
`prod_i numbers[i]**count_i * C(total_count, count_0, count_1, ...)`
and we only keep selections whose sum-of-counts (written in binary) contains exactly `target_odd` ones. The function below computes this number modulo `MOD = 10**9 + 7`.

üîç **Example Input / Output**  
(These are illustrative; the function handles general inputs.)
- Input: `total_count=2, target_odd=1, numbers=[2,3]`  
  Output: an integer (number of weighted selections where the binary sum of counts has exactly one `1`).
- The code returns the result modulo `10**9 + 7`.

üß† **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. **State and recursion:** The algorithm uses a top-down DP (`dfs`) with memoization keyed by `(remaining, odd_needed, index, carry)`, where:
   - `remaining` = how many more items must be chosen (initially `total_count`),
   - `odd_needed` = how many `1` bits are still required in the final binary sum,
   - `index` = current category in `numbers` we are choosing counts from,
   - `carry` = the integer carry that has propagated from less significant bits to the current bit position when summing the counts in binary.
2. **Bitwise handling / carry logic:** We process categories one-by-one, but interpret the *sum of counts* bitwise: when we decide to take `take` items from the current category, we add `take` to the running `carry`, and the lowest bit of the new carry (`new_carry % 2`) becomes the bit contributed at the current binary position (so we decrement `odd_needed` by that bit). Then we right-shift the carry (`new_carry // 2`) and move to the next index (the next bit position). This is how the algorithm enforces the exact number of 1-bits in the binary representation of the total sum.
3. **Combinatorics & weights:** For each choice `take` (0..`remaining`) at the current index:
   - The number of ways to choose which of the remaining positions are assigned to this category is `math.comb(remaining, take)` (multinomial combinatorics handled iteratively),
   - The multiplicative weight for taking `take` items from `numbers[index]` is `numbers[index]**take` (done with `pow(..., MOD)`).
   - Multiply ways √ó weight √ó recursive result for the updated state.
4. **Pruning & base cases:** The recursion prunes impossible states early:
   - If `remaining < 0` or `odd_needed < 0` ‚Üí 0 ways.
   - If even after using all remaining items + bits in `carry` it's impossible to reach `odd_needed` ones ‚Üí 0.
   - If `remaining == 0` we check whether the remaining `odd_needed` equals the popcount of the current `carry` (because when no more items are left, the remaining carry's bits are the remaining bits of the total sum).
5. **Memoization:** `@lru_cache(None)` caches intermediate results so overlapping subproblems are reused.

    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def magicalSum(self, total_count: int, target_odd: int, numbers: List[int]) -> int:

            @lru_cache(None)
            def dfs(remaining, odd_needed, index, carry):
                # prune impossible states
                if remaining < 0 or odd_needed < 0:
                    return 0
                # even if we convert all remaining into 1-bits plus current carry bits,
                # we cannot reach odd_needed
                if remaining + carry.bit_count() < odd_needed:
                    return 0

                # if no items remaining, the remaining bits come from the carry
                if remaining == 0:
                    return 1 if odd_needed == carry.bit_count() else 0

                # if exhausted all number categories but still items remain -> impossible
                if index >= len(numbers):
                    return 0

                ans = 0
                # choose how many to take from numbers[index]
                for take in range(remaining + 1):
                    # number of ways to choose which positions (multinomial factor)
                    ways = math.comb(remaining, take) * pow(numbers[index], take, MOD) % MOD
                    new_carry = carry + take
                    # the bit at this position is new_carry % 2; reduce odd_needed accordingly
                    ans += ways * dfs(remaining - take, odd_needed - (new_carry % 2), index + 1, new_carry // 2)
                    ans %= MOD
                return ans

            return dfs(total_count, target_odd, 0, 0)

‚è± **Complexity Analysis**  
- Let `T = total_count`, `L = len(numbers)`.  
- **Time:** In the worst case the recursion explores, for many states, all `take` values 0..`remaining`, so a very loose upper bound is `O(L * T^2)` (since for each index and remaining we may loop up to `T` takes and there are `O(T)` distinct `remaining` values). The carry dimension and `odd_needed` add extra states; therefore the real complexity can be higher and depends on how the carry shrinks across indices. In practice this approach is exponential in the worst case but is heavily pruned by the bitwise constraints and memoization.  
- **Space:** The memo table may store up to `O(L * T * U)` states where `U` is the number of distinct carry values encountered (bounded by `T`), so worst-case space `O(L * T^2)`. Recursive stack depth is `O(L)`.

> Note: Because combinatorics and `pow` are computed inside the inner loop, and because `math.comb` for large `T` can be expensive, performance may degrade for large `total_count` or many `numbers`. If inputs can be large, consider optimizations described below.

üß™ **Edge Cases & Notes**  
- `total_count == 0`: the code returns `1` iff `target_odd == 0` (empty selection has zero `1` bits).  
- `numbers` containing `0` is handled (0**0 treated as 1 in combinatorial interpretation for `take==0` and mathematically `pow(0,0)` is 1 in Python), but be careful if semantics differ.  
- Large `total_count` or long `numbers` will make the algorithm slow or memory-heavy; this approach is best when `total_count` and `len(numbers)` are modest (e.g., ‚â§ 30‚Äì50 depending on pruning).  
- If `target_odd` is larger than `total_count`'s possible popcount, the function returns `0`.
- All arithmetic is modulo `10**9 + 7` to avoid overflow.

üîß **Possible Optimizations**  
- Precompute `pow(numbers[i], t, MOD)` for `t = 0..T` for each index to avoid repeated modular exponentiation.  
- Precompute binomial coefficients `math.comb(remaining, take)` in a table (Pascal triangle) up to `T` to speed combinations.  
- Replace the inner loop over `take` with convolution / generating-function techniques if `T` is large ‚Äî treat each category as polynomial `P_i(x) = sum_{t>=0} C(remaining,t)*numbers[i]^t * x^t` and convolve; then track binary popcount across coefficient indices using bitset-like transforms. This is more advanced but can reduce complexity for large inputs.
- If the problem constraints guarantee small `len(numbers)` and `total_count`, the current memoized DFS is typically simpler and adequate.
