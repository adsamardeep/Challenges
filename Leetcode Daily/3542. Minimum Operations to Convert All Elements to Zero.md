# 🏷 Minimum Operations to Create Non-Decreasing Subsequences

# 📜 Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, find the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing using a specific rule: each operation introduces a new increasing threshold value, and when an element is smaller than the last added threshold, previous thresholds are removed until order is restored. The goal is to count how many distinct increasing "levels" are required to traverse the array.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output
Input:
```

nums = [3, 1, 5, 4, 7]

```
Output:
```

3

Explanation:  
- Start with `3` → new level (count = 1).  
- `1` < `3` → pop, new level (`1`) ignored since it’s lower.  
- `5` > `3` → new level (count = 2).  
- `4` < `5` → pop, restore order.  
- `7` > `4` → new level (count = 3).  
Total = 3 operations.

# 🧠 Approach
1. Maintain a `stack` representing the currently active increasing thresholds.
2. Iterate over each number `n` in `nums`:
   - While the stack’s top is greater than `n`, pop elements to maintain a non-decreasing order.
   - Skip if `n` is zero (it cannot create a new threshold).
   - If the stack is empty or its top is less than `n`, increment the operation counter and push `n`.
3. The final result `res` represents the number of new increasing levels introduced in the array.

# 💻 Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            while stack and stack[-1] > n:
                stack.pop()
            if n == 0:
                continue
            if not stack or stack[-1] < n:
                res += 1
                stack.append(n)
        return res

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — each element is pushed and popped at most once.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — for the stack used to maintain thresholds.

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* `nums = []`: returns `0` (no elements).
* All zeros: returns `0` (no valid thresholds).
* Strictly increasing array: each element forms a new level.
* Strictly decreasing array: only the smallest positive element counts as one level.
* Repeated values: duplicates do not add new levels since `stack[-1] == n` is skipped.
