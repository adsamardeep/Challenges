# Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements

## 🧩 Problem Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, return the **maximum difference** between two elements such that:

- The later element is **greater** than the earlier one (i.e., `nums[j] > nums[i]` for `j > i`).

If no such pair exists, return `-1`.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [7, 1, 5, 4]  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The maximum difference is 5 - 1 = 4.
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        xMin, n = 10**9, len(nums)
        maxD = -1
        for x in nums:
            if x <= xMin:
                xMin = x
            else:
                maxD = max(maxD, x - xMin)
        return maxD
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` list — single pass through the array.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \) — constant extra space used.

---

## 📝 Notes

- This is a classic **prefix minimum** problem.
- The algorithm tracks the smallest element seen so far (`xMin`) and updates the maximum difference when a larger value is found.
- If the list is strictly non-increasing, the function correctly returns `-1`.
