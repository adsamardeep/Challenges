# Lexicographical Numbers

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, return a list of integers from `1` to `n` in **lexicographical (dictionary) order**.

You must solve this problem without using any built-in string sorting functions.

### Example

Input: `n = 13`  
Output: `[1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`

### Explanation

When all numbers from `1` to `13` are ordered as strings:
`["1","10","11","12","13","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]`

Converting back to integers gives the output.

## Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def lexicalOrder(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        curr = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            result.append(curr)
            if curr * 10 <= n:
                curr *= 10
            else:
                while curr % 10 == 9 or curr + 1 > n:
                    curr //= 10
                curr += 1
        return result
```

## How It Works

This approach simulates a **preorder traversal** of a 10-ary tree:

- Each node represents a number.
- Children are formed by appending digits 0 through 9 to the current number.
- It starts with `1`, then `10`, `100`, etc., diving deep before moving to the next sibling (`2`, `3`, etc.).

Instead of building strings and sorting them, it directly navigates through valid numeric paths to build the result efficiently.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as each number is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) extra (excluding the output list), since only a few variables are used for traversal.

This is an optimal solution for generating lexicographical order up to `n` without converting integers to strings.
