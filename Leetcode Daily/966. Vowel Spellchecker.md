# Spellchecker (Vowel & Case-Insensitive Matching)

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Implement a spellchecker that, given a `wordlist` and a list of `queries`, returns a corrected word for each query according to the following priority rules:
1. If the query exactly matches a word in `wordlist` (case-sensitive), return the query itself.
2. Otherwise, if the query matches a word in `wordlist` case-insensitively, return the first such word from `wordlist`.
3. Otherwise, if the query matches a word in `wordlist` after replacing every vowel (`a,e,i,o,u`) with `*` (case-insensitive), return the first such word from `wordlist`.
4. If none of the above match, return an empty string `""`.

This function should preserve the first occurrence from `wordlist` when resolving case-insensitive or vowel-errors matches.

🔍 **Example Input/Output**  
Input:
    wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"]
    queries  = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]

Output:
    ["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]

Explanation:
- "kite" exact → "kite"
- "Kite" case-insensitive match to first "KiTe" in wordlist → "KiTe"
- "KiTe" exact → "KiTe"
- "HARE" case-insensitive match to first "hare"/"Hare" occurrence → "Hare"
- "Hear" and "hear" -> no exact/case/vowel-match → ""
- "keti" vowel-error matches "KiTe" after de-voweling → "KiTe"
- etc.

🧠 **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Build a set `exact` of all words in `wordlist` for O(1) exact-match checks.  
2. Build a dictionary `caseMap` mapping the lowercase form of a word to its **first** occurrence in `wordlist`. This resolves case-insensitive matches and preserves order.  
3. Build a dictionary `vowelMap` mapping a de-voweled lowercase form (replace vowels with `*`) to the **first** occurrence in `wordlist`. This resolves “vowel error” matches.  
4. For each query:
   - If the query is in `exact`, append it (exact match).
   - Else compute `lower = q.lower()` and `devowel = deVowel(lower)`.
   - If `lower` in `caseMap` append `caseMap[lower]`.
   - Else if `devowel` in `vowelMap` append `vowelMap[devowel]`.
   - Else append `""`.
5. Return the list of resolved results.

    class Solution:
        def spellchecker(self, wordlist, queries):
            exact = set(wordlist)
            caseMap = {}
            vowelMap = {}

            for w in wordlist:
                lower = w.lower()
                devowel = self.deVowel(lower)
                if lower not in caseMap:
                    caseMap[lower] = w
                if devowel not in vowelMap:
                    vowelMap[devowel] = w

            result = []
            for q in queries:
                if q in exact:
                    result.append(q)
                else:
                    lower = q.lower()
                    devowel = self.deVowel(lower)
                    if lower in caseMap:
                        result.append(caseMap[lower])
                    elif devowel in vowelMap:
                        result.append(vowelMap[devowel])
                    else:
                        result.append("")
            return result

        def deVowel(self, s):
            return ''.join('*' if c in 'aeiou' else c for c in s)

⏱ **Complexity Analysis**  
- Let `N = len(wordlist)`, `M = len(queries)`, and `L` be the average word length.
- Building `exact`: O(N * L) time and O(N * L) space to store words.  
- Building `caseMap` and `vowelMap`: each word requires O(L) to lowercase and O(L) to de-vowel → O(N * L) time; maps use O(N * L) space.  
- Query processing: for each query, lowercasing and de-voweling is O(L), and dictionary/set lookups are O(1) average → O(M * L) time.  
- **Overall Time:** O((N + M) * L).  
- **Space:** O(N * L) for maps and the exact set (plus O(M) for the output).

🧪 **Edge Cases**  
- **Preserve first occurrence:** If `wordlist` contains duplicates or same lowercase/de-voweled forms, the first occurrence must be used — code checks `if key not in map:` to ensure this.  
- **Empty strings** in `wordlist` or `queries` — empty string lowercases to `""`, deVowel -> `""` (no vowels), should behave consistently.  
- **Uppercase vowels:** Code lowercases words/queries before de-voweling, so uppercase vowels are correctly handled.  
- **Non-letter characters:** Non-letter characters remain unchanged by `deVowel`; if allowed, they are treated literally.  
- **All vowels replaced:** If a word becomes all `*` after de-voweling, multiple distinct words can map to the same devowel key; first occurrence rules apply.  
- **Performance on long lists/words:** Algorithm is linear in total characters, suitable for typical constraints; avoid repeated expensive operations inside hot loops (this code does lowercase and de-vowel once per word/query).
