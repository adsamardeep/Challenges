# Count and Say

This repository contains a solution to the **"Count and Say"** problem.

## Problem Description

The "Count and Say" sequence is a series of numbers where each term is generated by describing the previous term. The first few terms of the sequence are:

**1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221**

Here's how it works:
- `1` is read off as **"one 1"** → `11`
- `11` is read off as **"two 1s"** → `21`
- `21` is read off as **"one 2, then one 1"** → `1211`
- `1211` is read off as **"one 1, one 2, two 1s"** → `111221`

Given an integer `n`, return the `n`th term of this sequence as a string.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        res = "1"
        for _ in range(1, n):
            res = self.build_next(res)
        return res

    def build_next(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = ""
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                result += str(count) + s[i - 1]
                count = 1
        result += str(count) + s[-1]
        return result
