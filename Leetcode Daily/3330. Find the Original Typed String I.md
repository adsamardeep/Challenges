# Count Possible Strings After Removing Consecutive Characters

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given a string `word`, count how many different strings can be obtained by **removing at most one character** such that **no two consecutive characters are the same**.

The goal is to compute how many valid strings remain after potentially removing one character, where a valid string is one that does **not** contain **any consecutive identical characters**.

## ✅ Solution

### 🔹 Strategy

We start with a total of `n` possible strings by removing each of the `n` characters once (or none at all).

However, if two consecutive characters are **different**, removing either one of them will still maintain the property of having no two adjacent characters the same. But if two adjacent characters are the **same**, removing just one of them can eliminate the repetition.

Therefore, we **decrease the count** for every `i` where `word[i] != word[i - 1]`, because removing either of those characters wouldn't eliminate a repetition—it would still remain valid regardless.

### 🧑‍💻 Code

```python
class Solution:
    def possibleStringCount(self, word: str) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        count = n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if word[i] != word[i - 1]:
                count -= 1
        return count
