# Number of Laser Beams in a Bank (LeetCode: "Number of Laser Beams in a Bank")

üìú **Problem Statement**  
A bank‚Äôs security system is represented by a list of binary strings `bank`, where each string represents a row of security devices:  
- `'1'` ‚Üí a device is present  
- `'0'` ‚Üí no device  

A laser beam is formed between every device in one non-empty row and every device in the next **non-empty** row.  
You must return the total number of beams in the entire bank.

üîç **Example Input / Output**  
**Input**  
    bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]

**Output**  
    15  

**Explanation**  
- Row 1 ‚Üí 4 devices  
- Row 2 ‚Üí 0 devices (ignored)  
- Row 3 ‚Üí 3 devices  
- Row 4 ‚Üí 1 device  

Beams form only between consecutive **non-empty** rows:  
- Between row1 (4 devices) and row3 (3 devices): 4√ó3 = 12 beams  
- Between row3 (3 devices) and row4 (1 device): 3√ó1 = 3 beams  
Total = **12 + 3 = 15**

üß† **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Initialize `beams = 0` (total beams) and `prev = 0` (number of devices in previous non-empty row).  
2. Iterate over each row of the bank:  
   - Count number of `'1'`s ‚Üí `devices = row.count("1")`.  
   - If `devices == 0`, skip this row.  
   - Otherwise, add `beams += prev * devices` (each device in previous row connects to all in current row).  
   - Update `prev = devices`.  
3. Return `beams`.

üíª **Code**  

    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def numberOfBeams(self, bank: List[str]) -> int:
            beams, prev = 0, 0
            for row in bank:
                devices = row.count("1")
                if devices:
                    beams += prev * devices
                    prev = devices
            return beams

‚è± **Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time:** O(m √ó n), where `m` = number of rows, `n` = length of each row (to count `'1'`s).  
- **Space:** O(1), only constant extra memory.

üß™ **Edge Cases**  
- All rows empty ‚Üí 0 beams  
- Only one non-empty row ‚Üí 0 beams  
- Multiple consecutive non-empty rows ‚Üí beam count = sum of products of consecutive device counts  
- Works with any length of binary strings

‚úÖ **Example Walkthrough**
| Row | Devices | Prev | New Beams | Total |
|------|----------|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 4 | - | 0 |
| 3 | 3 | 4 | 12 | 12 |
| 4 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 15 |

‚úÖ **Final Answer:** 15
