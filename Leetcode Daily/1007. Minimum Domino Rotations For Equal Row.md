# Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row

## Problem Description

You are given two lists `tops` and `bottoms` representing the top and bottom halves of dominoes, respectively. Each domino can be rotated (swapped top and bottom), and your goal is to determine the **minimum number of rotations** required so that all values in either the top row or the bottom row are the same.

Each value in `tops` and `bottoms` is an integer from 1 to 6, like a standard domino. If it is impossible to make all the values in either row equal, return `-1`.

### Example

**Input:**  
`tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2]`  
`bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
We can rotate the second and fourth domino to make all the values in the top row equal to `2`.

## Approach

- Try all values from `1` to `6` as the potential target value to unify a row.
- For each value:
  - Check if it's possible to make all entries in either `tops` or `bottoms` equal to that value.
  - Count the minimum number of rotations required (either from top to bottom or bottom to top).
- Return the smallest rotation count that makes it possible.

If no value from 1 to 6 can unify a row, return `-1`.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minDominoRotations(self, tops, bottoms):
        res = float('inf')
        for val in range(1, 7):
            top_swaps = bottom_swaps = 0
            valid = True
            for t, b in zip(tops, bottoms):
                if t != val and b != val:
                    valid = False
                    break
                if t != val:
                    top_swaps += 1
                if b != val:
                    bottom_swaps += 1
            if valid:
                res = min(res, top_swaps, bottom_swaps)
        return -1 if res == float('inf') else res
```
