# âž— Minimum Difference in Sums After Split

This repository contains a Python solution to the problem of minimizing the difference between the sum of two parts of an array after optimally selecting elements.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Overview

Given an array `nums` of length `3n`, you are to:

- Split `nums` into **three equal parts**: `[0:n]`, `[n:2n]`, and `[2n:3n]`
- Choose `n` elements from the **first 2n elements** to minimize the **difference** between the sum of the chosen elements and the sum of the **best n elements from the last 2n elements**

### Goal:
Minimize:  
```
sum(selected_from_left_half) - sum(selected_from_right_half)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Example

```python
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9]
Split: [1, 3], [5, 2], [7, 9] (n=2)
Possible combinations:
Left best 2 = [1, 3] â†’ sum = 4
Right best 2 = [9, 7] â†’ sum = 16
Difference = 4 - 16 = -12
```

## ðŸš€ Approach

- Use a **max-heap** (inverted min-heap) for the **left side**, so we can maintain the smallest sum of `n` elements.
- Use a **min-heap** for the **right side**, so we can maintain the largest sum of `n` elements.
- Precompute prefix sums from the left and suffix sums from the right:
  - Track `n` smallest values from the left
  - Track `n` largest values from the right
- Compute the **difference** at each potential middle split and return the minimum.

## ðŸ’» Code Example

```python
from typing import List
from heapq import heapify, heapreplace

class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums) // 3
        diff = [0] * (n + 1)

        # Initialize max-heap for the left part
        pqL = [-x for x in nums[:n]]
        heapify(pqL)
        Sum = sum(nums[:n])
        ans = Sum

        # Build prefix sum for the left side
        for i in range(n, 2 * n + 1):
            diff[i - n] = Sum
            x = nums[i]
            if x >= -pqL[0]:
                continue
            Sum += x + pqL[0]
            heapreplace(pqL, -x)

        # Initialize min-heap for the right part
        pqR = nums[2 * n:]
        heapify(pqR)
        Sum = sum(pqR)
        ans -= Sum

        # Build suffix sum for the right side and compute min difference
        for i in range(2 * n - 1, n - 2, -1):
            diff[i - n + 1] -= Sum
            ans = min(ans, diff[i - n + 1])
            x = nums[i]
            if x <= pqR[0]:
                continue
            Sum += x - pqR[0]
            heapreplace(pqR, x)

        return ans
```

## ðŸ§  Notes

- This problem is a classic **greedy + heap** combination.
- It optimally maintains rolling best sums on both ends, ensuring an efficient solution in **O(n log n)** time.
