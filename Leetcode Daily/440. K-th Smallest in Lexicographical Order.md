# K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order

## Problem Description

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k`-th smallest integer in the range `[1, n]` when all the numbers are sorted **lexicographically** (i.e., in dictionary order).

You must do this without generating the entire list explicitly, as `n` can be as large as 10⁹.

### Example

Input: `n = 13`, `k = 2`  
Output: `10`

### Explanation

All numbers from `1` to `13` in lexicographical order:
`[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`  
The 2nd number is `10`.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findKthNumber(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        def get_count(prefix, n):
            count = 0
            current = prefix
            next_prefix = prefix + 1
            while current <= n:
                count += min(n + 1, next_prefix) - current
                current *= 10
                next_prefix *= 10
            return count

        curr = 1
        k -= 1  # starting from 1

        while k > 0:
            count = get_count(curr, n)
            if count <= k:
                curr += 1
                k -= count
            else:
                curr *= 10
                k -= 1

        return curr
```

## How It Works

This solution uses a prefix-based traversal of numbers in lexicographical order (similar to a trie or 10-ary tree traversal):

- `get_count(prefix, n)` counts how many numbers start with a given prefix.
- Starting from prefix `1`, it checks if the entire subtree under `prefix` has enough numbers to reach `k`.
  - If yes, go deeper (`prefix *= 10`).
  - If no, move to next sibling (`prefix += 1`), and subtract the whole subtree count from `k`.

This ensures we efficiently "skip over" whole branches of the lex-order tree without generating them.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n × log n), since at each level we multiply/divide by 10 to move through the digit tree.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), only a few variables are used.

This approach is optimal and scalable even when `n` is in the order of billions.
