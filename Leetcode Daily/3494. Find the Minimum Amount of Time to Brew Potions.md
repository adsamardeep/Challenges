# Minimum Time to Complete Skill Training (Dynamic Programming Optimization)

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Given two integer arrays `skill` (length `n`) and `mana` (length `m`), compute the minimal total time (or cost) required to complete a sequence of skill trainings. Each `mana[j]` corresponds to the mana cost multiplier for training phase `j`, and each `skill[i]` represents the difficulty of the i-th skill.  

At each phase `j`, the time (cost) accumulates in a dynamic way depending on all prior computed values for `done[i]`, where `done[i]` represents the best (maximum or minimal residual) accumulated value after processing `i` skills so far. The recurrence optimizes skill progression over multiple training rounds.

Although this exact setup does not map directly to a known standard named problem, the pattern resembles a **cumulative DP with forward-backward relaxation**, often used in resource allocation or multi-stage optimization problems.

🔍 **Example Input/Output**  
**Input**
    skill = [1, 2, 3]
    mana = [2, 1]

**Output**
    12

**Explanation (conceptually)**  
- In the first round (`mana = 2`), cumulative values are built up through skills scaled by their difficulty.  
- In the second round (`mana = 1`), adjustments reduce values based on skill difficulty again, leading to final optimized result in `done[n] = 12`.

🧠 **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Initialize an array `done` of length `n + 1` to store intermediate results of accumulated time/costs.  
2. Iterate through each `mana[j]` phase:
   - **Forward pass:**  
     For each skill `i` in order, update `done[i+1]` to reflect the maximal accumulated value of completing up to `i+1` skills, scaled by current `mana[j] * skill[i]`.  
     ```python
     done[i + 1] = max(done[i + 1], done[i]) + mana[j] * skill[i]
     ```
   - **Backward pass:**  
     Propagate the adjustments in reverse order, effectively relaxing the state transitions to maintain monotonic optimality for next iterations.
     ```python
     done[i] = done[i + 1] - mana[j] * skill[i]
     ```
3. After all phases (`m`), return `done[n]` as the final computed minimum total time (or total accumulated value).

💻 **Code**  

    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def minTime(self, skill: List[int], mana: List[int]) -> int:
            n, m = len(skill), len(mana)
            done = [0] * (n + 1)
            
            for j in range(m):
                # Forward accumulation (greedy or DP propagation)
                for i in range(n):
                    done[i + 1] = max(done[i + 1], done[i]) + mana[j] * skill[i]
                # Backward adjustment (relax backward dependencies)
                for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
                    done[i] = done[i + 1] - mana[j] * skill[i]
                    
            return done[n]

⏱ **Complexity Analysis**  
- Let `n = len(skill)`, `m = len(mana)`.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n × m) — two linear passes per `mana[j]`.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the `done` array.  

🧪 **Edge Cases**  
- `skill` or `mana` empty → return `0` (no computation needed).  
- All zeros in `skill` or `mana` → result is `0`.  
- Large `skill` or `mana` values → result may grow large; Python handles big integers.  
- Single skill or single mana → algorithm still valid (forward and backward pass consistent).  
- If `mana` has increasing pattern, earlier rounds have stronger influence; if decreasing, later rounds dominate due to scaling in forward/backward adjustments.

💡 **Note:**  
This DP-like formulation’s behavior depends heavily on the problem’s hidden semantics (e.g., training phases or progressive resource allocation).  
If you share the exact problem description or constraints (e.g., from a contest or platform), I can rewrite it in a canonical form (e.g., “minimum energy to master all skills” or “maximize score after m rounds”).
