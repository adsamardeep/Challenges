# Minimize Maximum Difference After Digit Replacement

## üß© Problem Description

Given an integer `num`, you are allowed to perform two digit replacement operations to create a **maximum** and **minimum** number from it:

1. **Maximum Number:** Replace all occurrences of **one digit** (not '9') with **'9'**.
2. **Minimum Number:** Replace all occurrences of the **first digit** with **'0'**.

Return the **difference** between the maximum and minimum numbers formed from these operations.

### Example
```python
Input: num = 11891  
Output: 99009  
Explanation:
- Max: Replace '1' with '9' ‚áí 99899
- Min: Replace '1' with '0' ‚áí 00890 ‚áí 890
- Difference: 99899 - 890 = 99009
```

## üêç Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minMaxDifference(self, num: int) -> int:
        s = str(num)
        
        # Maximize: Replace first non-'9' digit with '9'
        ch = next((c for c in s if c != '9'), None)
        mx = ''.join(('9' if c == ch else c for c in s) if ch else s)
        
        # Minimize: Replace all occurrences of the first digit with '0'
        ch0 = s[0]
        mn = ''.join('0' if c == ch0 else c for c in s)
        
        return int(mx) - int(mn)
```

## ‚úÖ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of digits in `num`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) for the string and list operations used in replacements.

---

## üìù Notes

- This solution works by converting the number to a string for easy digit manipulation.
- It uses greedy replacements to form the maximum and minimum versions of the number.
- `next(...)` with a generator efficiently finds the first non-'9' digit for max transformation.
