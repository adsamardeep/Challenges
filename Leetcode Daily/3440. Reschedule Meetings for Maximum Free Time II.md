# 🗓️ Max Free Time with Optional Meeting Removal

This repository contains a Python solution to find the **maximum possible free time** in a given schedule, allowing at most **one meeting to be removed**. The algorithm intelligently analyzes gaps between meetings and evaluates the benefit of removing each meeting to create a larger free interval.

## 📘 Problem Overview

You are given:
- `eventTime`: The total time frame (e.g., the workday duration).
- `startTime[]` and `endTime[]`: Lists of start and end times for `n` scheduled meetings (unordered).

Your task is to compute the **maximum free time** that can be achieved:
- Either by **keeping the schedule as is** and finding the largest free gap,
- Or by **removing one meeting** to create a larger combined gap before and after it.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Sorts and merges meeting intervals automatically
- Calculates gaps before, between, and after meetings
- Evaluates the **benefit of removing any one meeting**
- Optimizes using **precomputed prefix/suffix max gap arrays**

## 🧠 Algorithm Steps

1. **Sort Meetings:** Sort all events by start time to process them chronologically.
2. **Compute Gaps:** Build a `gaps` array representing:
   - Time before the first meeting
   - Gaps between meetings
   - Time after the last meeting
3. **Precompute Maximum Gaps:**
   - `maxBefore[i]` = max gap before the `i-th` meeting
   - `maxAfter[i]` = max gap after the `i-th` meeting
4. **Evaluate Each Meeting for Removal:**
   - Compute combined left and right gap
   - If the meeting's duration is less than the best outside gap, consider merging
5. **Compare with Unmodified Gaps:**
   - Also track the largest gap when keeping all meetings intact

## 💻 Code Example

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxFreeTime(self, eventTime: int, startTime: List[int], endTime: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(startTime)

        # Step 1: Combine and sort intervals
        intervals = sorted(zip(startTime, endTime))

        # Step 2: Calculate gaps
        gaps = [intervals[0][0]]
        for i in range(1, n):
            gaps.append(intervals[i][0] - intervals[i - 1][1])
        gaps.append(eventTime - intervals[-1][1])

        # Step 3: Precompute max gaps
        maxBefore = [0] * (n + 2)
        maxAfter = [0] * (n + 2)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            maxBefore[i] = max(maxBefore[i - 1], gaps[i - 1])
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            maxAfter[i] = max(maxAfter[i + 1], gaps[i])

        maxFree = 0

        # Step 4: Try removing each meeting
        for i in range(n):
            duration = intervals[i][1] - intervals[i][0]
            leftGap = gaps[i]
            rightGap = gaps[i + 1]
            combinedGap = leftGap + rightGap

            bestOutsideGap = max(maxBefore[i] if i > 0 else 0,
                                 maxAfter[i + 2] if i < n - 1 else 0)

            if duration <= bestOutsideGap:
                maxFree = max(maxFree, combinedGap + duration)
            else:
                maxFree = max(maxFree, combinedGap)

        # Step 5: Consider original largest gap
        for gap in gaps:
            maxFree = max(maxFree, gap)

        return maxFree

# Example usage
eventTime = 100
startTime = [10, 30, 50, 70]
endTime = [20, 40, 60, 80]

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxFreeTime(eventTime, startTime, endTime))  # Output: maximum free time
