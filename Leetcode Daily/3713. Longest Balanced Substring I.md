# 🔤 Longest Balanced Substring

## 📜 Problem Statement

Given a lowercase string `s`, return the length of the longest substring such that:

> The number of distinct characters equals  
> The number of characters that appear the **maximum frequency** in that substring.

---

## 💡 What “Balanced” Means

For a substring:

- `uniq` = number of distinct letters
- `maxF` = highest frequency of any letter
- `cntMax` = how many letters appear `maxF` times

The substring is **balanced** if:

```

uniq == cntMax

````

---

## 🧠 Intuition

For every possible starting index `l`, expand the substring to the right:

At each step:

1. Update frequency of current character
2. Track:
   - number of distinct characters (`uniq`)
   - current maximum frequency (`maxF`)
   - how many characters have that maximum frequency (`cntMax`)
3. If `uniq == cntMax`, update answer

This checks every substring → brute-force with optimization.

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def longestBalanced(self, s: str) -> int:
        cnt, n = 1, len(s)

        for l in range(n):
            freq = [0] * 26
            uniq, maxF, cntMax = 0, 0, 0

            for r in range(l, n):
                idx = ord(s[r]) - 97
                freq[idx] += 1
                f = freq[idx]

                if f == 1:
                    uniq += 1

                if f > maxF:
                    maxF = f
                    cntMax = 1
                elif f == maxF:
                    cntMax += 1

                if uniq == cntMax:
                    cnt = max(cnt, r - l + 1)

        return cnt

## ⏱ Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n²)`

  * Two nested loops
* **Space:** `O(1)`

  * Frequency array of size 26

## 🔎 Example

### Input

```python
s = "aabbcc"
```

### Explanation

For substring `"aabbcc"`:

```
freq = {a:2, b:2, c:2}
uniq = 3
maxF = 2
cntMax = 3
```

Since:

```
uniq == cntMax
3 == 3 ✅
```

Answer = `6`

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* `"aaaa"` → `4`
* `"abc"` → `3`
* `"aab"` → `2`

---

## 🚀 Why This Works

Balanced means:

All distinct characters must tie for highest frequency.

So the substring must look like:

```
k characters each appearing exactly t times
```

Equivalent to:

```
length = k * t
```
