# 🟩 Problem: Generate n Unique Integers Sum to Zero

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return a list of `n` **unique integers** such that their sum is **0**.

---

## 🔍 Example

Input:  
    n = 5  

Output:  
    [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]  

Explanation:  
- The list contains 5 unique integers.  
- Their sum is -4 + -2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 0.  

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. We need `n` unique integers that sum to `0`.  
2. A simple way: arrange numbers symmetrically around `0`.  
   - For example, for `n=5`, we can generate `[-4,-2,0,2,4]`.  
   - For `n=4`, we can generate `[-3,-1,1,3]`.  
3. Formula approach:  
   - Generate each number with `i * 2 - n + 1` for `i` in `[0..n-1]`.  
   - This creates an arithmetic sequence centered around `0`.

## 💻 Code 
    class Solution:
        def sumZero(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
            return [i * 2 - n + 1 for i in range(n)]

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) (list comprehension of size n).  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (to store the resulting list).  

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- n = 1 → [0].  
- n = 2 → [-1, 1].  
- n is even → symmetric pairs, no zero included.  
- n is odd → includes 0 along with symmetric pairs.
