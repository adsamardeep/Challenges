# Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Equal Within K

## üß© Problem Description

Given a string `word` and an integer `k`, return the **minimum number of character deletions** needed so that the **frequency difference between any two remaining characters** is **at most `k`**.

You can delete characters as many times as needed but cannot insert or change characters.

### Example
```python
Input: word = "aabbccddeeffgg", k = 2  
Output: 0  
Explanation: All character frequencies are equal (2), and the difference between any two is ‚â§ 2.
```

Another example:
```python
Input: word = "aaaabbbbccccdd", k = 1  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Need to reduce frequencies so no two differ by more than 1.
```

## üêç Python Solution

```python
from collections import Counter
import bisect

class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count character frequencies
        freq = sorted(Counter(word).values())

        # Step 2: Compute prefix sum
        n = len(freq)
        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + freq[i]

        total = prefix[-1]
        min_del = float('inf')

        # Step 3: Try every frequency as target
        for i in range(n):
            target = freq[i]
            max_allowed = target + k

            # Step 4: Use binary search to find upper bound
            j = bisect.bisect_right(freq, max_allowed)

            # Step 5: Compute deletions
            delete_below = prefix[i]  # remove all below target
            delete_above = total - prefix[j] - (max_allowed * (n - j))  # trim excess above max_allowed
            deletions = delete_below + delete_above

            min_del = min(min_del, deletions)

        return min_del
```

## ‚úÖ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of unique characters in `word`, due to sorting and binary search.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) for storing frequencies and prefix sums.

---

## üìù Notes

- The algorithm considers every unique frequency as a potential **target frequency**.
- It removes characters with lower frequency entirely and trims down characters with frequency too high (beyond `target + k`).
- Binary search optimizes finding the cutoff point for allowed frequencies.
- Prefix sums help compute deletions efficiently without repeated summations.
