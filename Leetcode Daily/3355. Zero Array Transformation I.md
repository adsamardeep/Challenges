# Is Zero Array

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and a list of `queries`. Each query is a pair `[l, r]` representing a range of indices (inclusive). 

Each query represents an increment operation: for every index `i` in `[l, r]`, increase `nums[i]` by 1. You are asked to **reverse** all of these operations and check whether it's possible to get an array with all zeros or less at every index.

In other words, apply the **reverse** of these increments to `nums`, and return `True` if no element in the resulting array is greater than zero; otherwise, return `False`.

### Example:

```
Input: 
nums = [2, 1, 1, 0]
queries = [[0, 2], [1, 3]]

Output:
True

Explanation:
- First, we assume each query increased a range.
- We reverse this increment using a difference array approach.
- If all resulting values in nums - delta are â‰¤ 0, the function returns True.
```

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isZeroArray(self, nums: list[int], queries: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        delta = [0] * (n + 1)

        # Apply range increments using difference array
        for q in queries:
            l, r = q
            delta[l] += 1
            if r + 1 < n:
                delta[r + 1] -= 1

        # Build prefix sum array to get final increment count at each index
        new_delta = [0] * n
        new_delta[0] = delta[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            new_delta[i] = new_delta[i - 1] + delta[i]

        # Apply the reverse transformation
        for i in range(n):
            reduced = nums[i] - new_delta[i]
            if reduced > 0:
                return False

        return True
```
