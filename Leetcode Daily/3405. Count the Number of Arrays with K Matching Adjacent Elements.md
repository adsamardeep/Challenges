# Count Good Arrays

## üß© Problem Description

Given integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, count the number of **good arrays** of length `n` such that:

- Each element is an integer from `1` to `m`.
- Exactly `k` positions (excluding the first) are where the current element is **different** from the previous one (i.e., the array has exactly `k` *jumps* or *changes*).
- The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Example
```python
Input: n = 4, m = 3, k = 2  
Output: 18  
Explanation: You can start with any number from 1 to 3, and exactly 2 changes are allowed from left to right.
```

## üêç Python Solution

```python
mx = 10**5 + 10
mod = 10**9 + 7

# Precompute factorials and modular inverses
f = [1] + [0] * mx
g = [1] + [0] * mx

for i in range(1, mx):
    f[i] = f[i - 1] * i % mod
    g[i] = pow(f[i], mod - 2, mod)

# Combinatorics function: C(m, n)
def comb(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    return f[m] * g[n] * g[m - n] % mod

class Solution:
    def countGoodArrays(self, n: int, m: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Choose k positions to change, then multiply choices:
        # m options for the first number,
        # (m-1) options for each change.
        return comb(n - 1, k) * m * pow(m - 1, n - k - 1, mod) % mod
```

## ‚úÖ Complexity Analysis

- **Precomputation Time:**  
  \( O(mx) \) for factorials and inverses (done once).
- **Query Time:**  
  \( O(1) \) per call after precomputation.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(mx) \) for storing factorials and inverses.

## üìù Notes

- The total number of such arrays is calculated by:
  - Choosing `k` positions among `n - 1` where changes occur.
  - Selecting a value for the first element (`m` choices).
  - For each change, selecting a value different from the previous one (`m - 1` choices).
- Modular arithmetic and precomputed factorials enable efficient combinatorial calculations even for large values of `n`.
