# Count Valid Strings After Removing Up to k Characters

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given a string `word` consisting of lowercase letters, and an integer `k`, compute the number of **valid strings** that can be obtained by **removing exactly `k` characters**, such that **no two adjacent characters are the same** in the resulting string.

Return the count **modulo** `10⁹ + 7`.

## ✅ Solution

### 🔹 Strategy

1. **Group Consecutive Characters**:
   - Traverse the string and group identical consecutive characters.
   - For example, `"aaabbbaa"` → groups: `[3, 3, 2]`.

2. **Total Combinations**:
   - The total number of ways to pick one character from each group (to maintain uniqueness) is the **product of group sizes**.

3. **Invalid Selections**:
   - When `k` exceeds the number of groups, it implies some groups must have **more than one character removed**, potentially making consecutive characters the same.
   - Use **dynamic programming** to count the number of **invalid combinations**.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - `valid = total - invalid` (modulo `10⁹ + 7`)

### 🧑‍💻 Code

```python
class Solution:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def possibleStringCount(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        if not word:
            return 0

        groups = []
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(word)):
            if word[i] == word[i - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                groups.append(count)
                count = 1
        groups.append(count)

        total = 1
        for num in groups:
            total = (total * num) % self.MOD

        if k <= len(groups):
            return total

        dp = [0] * k
        dp[0] = 1

        for num in groups:
            new_dp = [0] * k
            sum_val = 0
            for s in range(k):
                if s > 0:
                    sum_val = (sum_val + dp[s - 1]) % self.MOD
                if s > num:
                    sum_val = (sum_val - dp[s - num - 1] + self.MOD) % self.MOD
                new_dp[s] = sum_val
            dp = new_dp

        invalid = sum(dp[len(groups):k]) % self.MOD
        return (total - invalid + self.MOD) % self.MOD
