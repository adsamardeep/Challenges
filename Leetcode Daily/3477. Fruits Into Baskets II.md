# 🍓 `numOfUnplacedFruits` – Count Unplaced Fruits Based on Basket Capacity

## 📘 Problem Statement

You are given two lists:

- `fruits` → Each element represents the **size** of a fruit.
- `baskets` → Each element represents the **capacity** of a basket.

**Goal:**  
Determine how many fruits cannot be placed in any basket.

### 🍽 Placement Rule:
- A fruit can be placed in a basket **if its size is ≤ basket's capacity**.
- Each basket can hold **at most one fruit**.

---

### ✅ Example

```python
Input: fruits = [2, 3, 5], baskets = [3, 4, 1]
Output: 1

# Explanation:
# - Fruit 2 → Basket 3 ✅
# - Fruit 3 → Basket 4 ✅
# - Fruit 5 → ❌ No basket available
# => 1 fruit left unplaced
```

---

## 🧠 Approach

1. Traverse each fruit one by one.
2. For each fruit, find the **first available** basket that can hold it.
3. If placed, mark the basket as used (`-1`).
4. Count how many fruits were placed.
5. Return the number of fruits **not placed**.

## 📄 Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits: list[int], baskets: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(fruits)
        alloted = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if fruits[i] <= baskets[j]:
                    baskets[j] = -1  # mark as used
                    alloted += 1
                    break
        return n - alloted
```

---

## 🕒 Complexity

- **Time**: O(n²)  
  (Each fruit checks up to `n` baskets.)
- **Space**: O(1)  
  (In-place marking of used baskets.)

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- `fruits = [1,2,3], baskets = [0,0,0]` → All unplaced → Output: 3
- `fruits = [], baskets = []` → No fruits to place → Output: 0
- `fruits = [1], baskets = [1]` → Exact match → Output: 0
