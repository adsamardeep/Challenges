# 🍀 Problem: Check if a Number is a Power of Three

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, determine whether it is a **power of three**.  
A number is a power of three if it can be written as:

\[
n = 3^k \quad \text{for some integer } k \ge 0
\]

Return `True` if `n` is a power of three, otherwise `False`.

## 🔍 Example 1
**Input**
```python
n = 27
```

**Explanation**
```
27 = 3 × 9
9 = 3 × 3
3 = 3 × 1
```
`n` reduces to 1 by dividing by 3 repeatedly → **True**.

**Output**
```
True
```

---

## 🔍 Example 2
**Input**
```python
n = 45
```

**Explanation**
```
45 ÷ 3 = 15 (not divisible by 3 anymore)
```
We cannot reach 1 by dividing only by 3 → **False**.

**Output**
```
False
```

## 🧠 Approach
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be a power of three → return `False`.
2. While `n` is divisible by 3, keep dividing it by 3.
3. After the loop, if `n` equals 1 → return `True`, else `False`.

## 💻 Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        while n % 3 == 0:
            n //= 3
        return n == 1
```

---

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(log₃ n) — each division by 3 reduces `n` significantly.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — constant memory usage.

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- `n = 0` → False (cannot be a power of three)
- `n = 1` → True (3⁰ = 1)
- Large values like `n = 3^20` → should return True efficiently.
