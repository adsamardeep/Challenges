# Longest Subsequence Repeated K Times

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `K`, find the **longest possible string `t`** such that:

- `t` is a **subsequence** of `s`
- Repeating `t` exactly `K` times (i.e., `t * K`) is also a subsequence of `s`
- Among all such strings, return the **lexicographically largest** one

A **subsequence** of a string is a sequence that can be derived from the string by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## ✅ Solution

This solution uses a combination of **preprocessing**, **binary search**, and **depth-first search (DFS)** to efficiently find the desired string.

### 🔹 Step 1: Preprocessing (`nextPos` Table)
Create a table `nextPos` where:
- `nextPos[i][c]` stores the next position after index `i` where character `'a' + c` appears
- This allows quick subsequence checks

### 🔹 Step 2: Binary Search on Length
Perform binary search over possible lengths of the answer (`1` to `len(s) // K`) to find the longest valid subsequence.

### 🔹 Step 3: DFS with Lexicographic Order
For each candidate length:
- Use DFS to build all possible strings in **reverse lexicographic** order (`'z'` to `'a'`)
- Prune invalid paths early to reduce search space

### 🔹 Step 4: Subsequence Repetition Check
To verify if a candidate string `t` is valid:
- Check if `t * K` is a subsequence of `s` using the `nextPos` table

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(self, s: str, K: int) -> str:
        n = len(s)

        # Step 1: Preprocessing - Build nextPos table
        # nextPos[i][c] = next index ≥ i where char 'a'+c appears
        nextPos = [[n] * 26 for _ in range(n + 2)]

        # Initialize final rows to sentinel n
        for c in range(26):
            nextPos[n][c] = nextPos[n + 1][c] = n

        # Fill table from right to left
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for c in range(26):
                nextPos[i][c] = nextPos[i + 1][c]
            nextPos[i][ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] = i

        low, high = 1, n // K
        res = ""

            found = self.dfsTry(mid, K, 0, [''] * mid, s, nextPos)
            if found:
                res = found
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return res

                if result:

                if pos >= n:
                    return False
