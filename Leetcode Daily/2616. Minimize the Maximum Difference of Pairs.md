# Minimize Maximum Pair Difference

## üß© Problem Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, your goal is to form exactly `p` **non-overlapping pairs** such that the **maximum absolute difference** in any selected pair is minimized.

Each pair must consist of two distinct elements from `nums`, and no element can be part of more than one pair. The objective is to return the minimum possible value for the **maximum difference** among these `p` pairs.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [1, 3, 6, 19, 20], p = 2  
Output: 2  
Explanation: Pairs can be (1, 3) and (19, 20), where the max difference is 2.
```

## üêç Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeMax(self, nums: list[int], p: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)

        low, high = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]

        # Step 3: Binary search
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            # Step 4: Try to form pairs
            count = 0
            i = 1
            while i < n and count < p:
                if nums[i] - nums[i - 1] <= mid:
                    count += 1
                    i += 2
                else:
                    i += 1

            # Binary search update
            if count >= p:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1

        # Step 5: Return result
        return low
```

## ‚úÖ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n \log n + n \log D) \), where \( D \) is the difference between the max and min elements in `nums`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \) extra space (excluding sorting)

## üìù Notes

- Binary search is used to optimize over the answer space instead of checking every possible maximum difference.
- A greedy approach helps form the most pairs by scanning from left to right.
