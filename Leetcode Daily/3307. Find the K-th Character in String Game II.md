# K-th Character in a Binary-Tree-like Expansion with Operations

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You're given a string construction process that behaves like a **binary tree expansion**:

1. Start with a single character `'a'` (at the root).
2. At each level, duplicate the current string but apply a **character shift operation** (provided in a list `operations`) to the **right half** of the string.

For example, with operations = `[1, 2, 3]`:
- Level 0: `"a"`
- Level 1: `"a"` + `"b"` (shift `'a'` by 1)
- Level 2: `"ab"` + `"cd"` (shift `'ab'` by 2)
- Level 3: `"abcd"` + `"efgh"` (shift `'abcd'` by 3)
- And so on...

Given a value `k`, return the **k-th character** (1-based index) in the final string built following this process.

## ✅ Solution

This solution avoids building the full string by observing that:

- The string size **doubles** at each level.
- At each step, we can track whether the `k`-th character falls in the **left** or **right** half.
- If it falls in the **right half**, we accumulate the corresponding shift (`operations[i - 1]`) and move `k` to the correct position in the right subtree.
- This process repeats until the size reduces to 1, which gives us the base character `'a'` shifted by the total shift (`d`), modulo 26.

### 🧑‍💻 Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def kthCharacter(self, k: int, operations: List[int]) -> str:
        n, i = 1, 0
        while n < k:
            n *= 2
            i += 1
        d = 0
        while n > 1:
            if k > n // 2:
                k -= n // 2
                d += operations[i - 1]
            n //= 2
            i -= 1
        return chr(d % 26 + ord("a"))
