# Maximum Candies You Can Collect from Boxes

## Problem Description

You have several boxes, each of which may be:

- **Closed or open**
- Contain a number of candies
- Contain keys to other boxes
- Contain other boxes

You are given:

- `status[i]`: `1` if box `i` is open, else `0`
- `candies[i]`: number of candies in box `i`
- `keys[i]`: list of keys found in box `i`
- `containedBoxes[i]`: list of boxes found in box `i`
- `initialBoxes`: boxes you initially have access to

Your goal is to determine the **maximum number of candies** you can collect by opening boxes using the keys you find along the way.

Boxes can only be opened if:
- You have the box, **and**
- The box is open (either initially or because you find a key for it)

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCandies(self, status: List[int], candies: List[int], keys: List[List[int]], containedBoxes: List[List[int]], initialBoxes: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        To simplify code, reuse status:
        0 = closed
        1 = open
        2 = have box
        3 = have box and it's open (ready to process)
        """
        def dfs(i):
            ans = candies[i]
            status[i] = 0  # mark as processed
            for k in keys[i]:
                status[k] |= 1  # gain key (mark as open)
                if status[k] == 3:  # if we also have the box
                    ans += dfs(k)
            for j in containedBoxes[i]:
                status[j] |= 2  # gain box
                if status[j] == 3:  # if it's also open
                    ans += dfs(j)
            return ans

        cnt = 0
        for i in initialBoxes:
            status[i] |= 2  # mark as having the box
            if status[i] == 3:  # ready to open
                cnt += dfs(i)
        return cnt
