# Maximum Target Nodes in Two Graphs with BFS Radius Constraint

## Problem Description

You are given two **undirected graphs**:

- `edges1` with `n + 1` nodes,
- `edges2` with `m + 1` nodes,
- An integer `k`.

For each node `i` in `edges1`, compute the number of nodes reachable using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** within **`k` steps**.  
Simultaneously, for the second graph `edges2`, compute the **maximum number of nodes** reachable from any node using BFS within **`k - 1` steps**.

Return a list where for each node `i` in the first graph, the value is:
```
reachable_nodes_from_i_in_edges1 (within k steps) + max_reachable_in_edges2 (within k - 1 steps)
```

### Example:

```
Input:
edges1 = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]]
edges2 = [[0,1],[1,2]]
k = 2

Output:
[5, 5, 5, 5]

Explanation:
- For each node in edges1, 3 nodes (including itself) are reachable within 2 steps.
- In edges2, maximum nodes reachable from any node within 1 step = 2.
- So, result = [3+2, 3+2, 3+2, 3+2] = [5, 5, 5, 5]
```

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class Solution:
    def bfs(self, graph, k, start, n):
        visited = [False] * n
        q = deque([start])
        dist = 0
        cnt = 0
        visited[start] = True
        while q and dist <= k:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                cnt += 1
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if not visited[neighbor]:
                        visited[neighbor] = True
                        q.append(neighbor)
            dist += 1
        return cnt

    def maxTargetNodes(self, edges1, edges2, k):
        n = len(edges1)
        m = len(edges2)
        r1 = defaultdict(list)
        r2 = defaultdict(list)

        for u, v in edges1:
            r1[u].append(v)
            r1[v].append(u)

        for u, v in edges2:
            r2[u].append(v)
            r2[v].append(u)

        curr = [self.bfs(r1, k, i, n+1) for i in range(n+1)]
        dc = max(self.bfs(r2, k-1, i, m+1) for i in range(m+1))
        return [x + dc for x in curr]
```

## Notes

- The `bfs` method performs a level-based traversal and counts nodes reachable within a given distance `k`.
- The `maxTargetNodes`
