# Minimum Time to Reach Bottom-Right Cell

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D grid `moveTime` of size `m x n`, where each cell `moveTime[i][j]` represents the **earliest time** you are allowed to **step into** that cell. 

You start at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and aim to reach the bottom-right corner `(m-1, n-1)`. Each move takes exactly **1 unit of time**, and you can move up, down, left, or right.

Your task is to return the **minimum time required to reach the bottom-right corner**, adhering to the constraint that you can only move into a cell **at or after** its `moveTime` value.

If it's not possible to reach the bottom-right cell, return `-1`.

### Example

**Input:**
```
moveTime = [
  [0, 2],
  [1, 3]
]
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
- Start at (0, 0) at time 0
- Move to (1, 0) at time 1 (since moveTime[1][0] = 1)
- Move to (1, 1) at time 2 â†’ must wait until time 3
- Arrive at (1, 1) at time 4

## Approach

This problem is solved using **Dijkstra's algorithm** with a priority queue (min-heap):
- Each state is represented as `(current_time, row, col)`.
- For each adjacent cell, you can only move to it at `max(current_time, moveTime[next_cell]) + 1`.
- Track the shortest known arrival time for each cell to avoid reprocessing longer paths.

## Python Solution

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minTimeToReach(self, moveTime):
        m, n = len(moveTime), len(moveTime[0])
        dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
        dist[0][0] = 0
        heap = [(0, 0, 0)]  # time, row, col

        while heap:
            time, r, c = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if (r, c) == (m-1, n-1):
                return time
            for dr, dc in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n:
                    wait_time = max(time, moveTime[nr][nc]) + 1
                    if wait_time < dist[nr][nc]:
                        dist[nr][nc] = wait_time
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (wait_time, nr, nc))
        return -1
```
