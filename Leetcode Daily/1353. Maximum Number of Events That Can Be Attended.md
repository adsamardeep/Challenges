# 🗓️ Max Events Attended

This repository contains a Python implementation of a greedy algorithm that calculates the maximum number of events one can attend, given a list of events with start and end days.

## 📘 Problem Overview

You are given a list of events where each event is represented as a pair `[start, end]`. Each day, you can attend at most one event. Once you attend an event, you cannot attend another event on the same day. The goal is to attend the maximum number of non-overlapping events.

The approach is greedy — always attend the event that ends earliest among those available on a given day.

## 🚀 Features

- Efficient greedy scheduling using a **min-heap**
- Handles large event sets with optimal performance
- Early termination if all events are processed
- Simple and readable Python code

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Sort** the events by start day.
2. **Simulate each day** from 1 to the latest end day in the input.
3. Use a **min-heap** to store available events, sorted by end day.
4. On each day:
   - Add new events starting today.
   - Remove expired events.
   - Attend the event that ends earliest (pop from heap).

## 💻 Code Usage

```python
from typing import List
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        events.sort()
        min_heap = []
        i = 0
        n = len(events)
        count = 0
        last_day = max(end for _, end in events)

        for day in range(1, last_day + 1):
            while i < n and events[i][0] == day:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, events[i][1])
                i += 1
            while min_heap and min_heap[0] < day:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            if min_heap:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                count += 1
            if i == n and not min_heap:
                break
        return count

# Example usage
events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxEvents(events))  # Output: 3
