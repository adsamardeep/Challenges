# 🟩 Problem: Largest Area with Maximum Diagonal

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a list of rectangles, where each rectangle is represented by its **length** and **width**.  
Your task is to find the **area** of the rectangle that has the **longest diagonal**.  
- If multiple rectangles have the same longest diagonal, choose the one with the **largest area**.

## 🔍 Example 1
**Input**
    dimensions = [[9,3],[8,6]]

**Output**
    48

**Explanation**
- Rectangle `[9,3]` → diagonal² = 81 + 9 = 90, area = 27  
- Rectangle `[8,6]` → diagonal² = 64 + 36 = 100, area = 48  
- Max diagonal is `√100 = 10`, so answer = **48**

---

## 🔍 Example 2
**Input**
    dimensions = [[3,4],[5,12]]

**Output**
    60

**Explanation**
- Rectangle `[3,4]` → diagonal² = 9 + 16 = 25, area = 12  
- Rectangle `[5,12]` → diagonal² = 25 + 144 = 169, area = 60  
- Max diagonal is `√169 = 13`, so answer = **60**

## 🧠 Approach
1. For each rectangle `(l, w)`, compute:
   - `curr_diag = l² + w²` (to avoid floating-point issues with square roots).
   - `area = l * w`.
2. Track the **maximum diagonal** encountered:
   - If a rectangle has a longer diagonal, update both `max_diag` and `max_area`.
   - If diagonals are equal, choose the rectangle with the **larger area**.
3. Return the final `max_area`.

## 💻 Code Implementation
    class Solution:
        def areaOfMaxDiagonal(self, dimensions: list[list[int]]) -> int:
            max_area, max_diag = 0, 0

            for l, w in dimensions:
                curr_diag = l * l + w * w
                if curr_diag > max_diag or (curr_diag == max_diag and l * w > max_area):
                    max_diag = curr_diag
                    max_area = l * w

            return max_area

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — iterate once over all rectangles.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — only store a few variables.

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- Single rectangle → return its area.  
- Multiple rectangles with same diagonal → return the one with largest area.  
- All rectangles identical → return any (they have same area & diagonal).
