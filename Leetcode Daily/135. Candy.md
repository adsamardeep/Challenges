# Candy Distribution

## Problem Description

There are `n` children standing in a line, each with a rating represented by an integer in the `ratings` list. You are to distribute candies to these children under the following rules:

1. Each child must receive at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating than their immediate neighbor(s) must receive more candies than those neighbors.

The task is to determine the **minimum** number of candies you must give to distribute them according to these rules.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def candy(self, ratings):
        """
        :type ratings: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n  # Step 1: Give each child 1 candy initially

        # Step 2: Left to Right pass
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1

        # Step 3: Right to Left pass
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)

        # Step 4: Return total candies
        return sum(candies)
