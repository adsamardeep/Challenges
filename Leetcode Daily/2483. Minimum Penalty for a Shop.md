# 🏷 Best closing time to minimize customer penalty

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given a string `customers` consisting of `'Y'` and `'N'`, where `'Y'` indicates a customer arrives and `'N'` indicates no customer, determine the earliest hour to close a shop to minimize penalty. The penalty increases if the shop is closed when customers arrive (`'Y'`) or open when no customers arrive (`'N'`).

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
customers = "YYNY"
````

**Output:**

```python
2
```

**Explanation:**
Closing after hour `2` minimizes the total penalty compared to closing earlier or later.

## 🧠 Approach

1. Model the penalty change as a running prefix sum:

   * Seeing `'Y'` decreases the penalty by `1` (since staying open is good).
   * Seeing `'N'` increases the penalty by `1` (since staying open is bad).
2. Track the minimum prefix sum encountered while scanning the string.
3. The optimal closing time is immediately after the index where this minimum prefix sum occurs.
4. Initialize the best closing time as `0` (closing before any hours) with penalty `0`.
5. Update the best time whenever a lower penalty is found.

This transforms the problem into finding the minimum prefix sum.

## 💻 Code 

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def bestClosingTime(self, customers: str) -> int:
        bestTime = 0
        minPenalty = 0
        prefix = 0
        
        for i in range(len(customers)):
            prefix += -1 if customers[i] == 'Y' else 1
            
            if prefix < minPenalty:
                bestTime = i + 1
                minPenalty = prefix
        
        return bestTime
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `customers` string.
* Space complexity: **O(1)**, using only constant extra variables.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* All `'Y'` → best time is at the end (stay open all day).
* All `'N'` → best time is `0` (close immediately).
* Empty string → returns `0`.
* Multiple optimal closing times → earliest one is returned.
* Single-character input → handled correctly.
