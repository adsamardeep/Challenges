# 🏷 Largest Rectangle of 1s in a Binary Matrix

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with `'0'` and `'1'`, find the area of the **largest rectangle containing only `'1'`s**. The rectangle must be axis-aligned and contiguous.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
matrix = [
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
````

**Output:**

```python
6
```

**Explanation:**
The largest rectangle of 1s has area 6 (3 rows × 2 columns).

## 🧠 Approach

1. Treat each row as the base of a **histogram** where the height at each column is the count of consecutive `'1'`s ending at that row.
2. For each row:

   * Update histogram heights.
   * Append a sentinel `'0'` to flush remaining bars.
3. Use a **monotonic increasing stack** to compute the largest rectangle in the histogram:

   * When the current height is less than the height at the stack top, pop and compute area.
   * Width is determined by the distance between current index and the new stack top.
4. Track the maximum area across all rows.

## 💻 Code 

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        r, c = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        if r == 1 and c == 1:
            if matrix[0][0] == '1':
                return 1
            else:
                return 0

        h = [0] * (c + 1)
        maxArea = 0

        for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
            st = [-1]
            row.append('0')
            for j, x in enumerate(row):
                # build h
                if x == '1':
                    h[j] += 1
                else:
                    h[j] = 0
                # monotonic stack has at least element -1
                while len(st) > 1 and (j == c or h[j] < h[st[-1]]):
                    m = st[-1]
                    st.pop()
                    w = j - st[-1] - 1
                    area = h[m] * w
                    maxArea = max(maxArea, area)
                st.append(j)
        return maxArea
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(r × c)`
  Each cell is processed once; stack operations are amortized constant time.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(c)`
  For the histogram heights and stack.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Single cell matrix (`"0"` or `"1"`)
* Matrix with all zeros
* Matrix with all ones
* Single row or single column
* Rectangles spanning multiple rows and columns
