# 🏷 Largest Square Area from Rectangle Intersections

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given two lists:
- `bl`: bottom-left coordinates of rectangles
- `tr`: top-right coordinates of rectangles  

Each rectangle is axis-aligned.  
Your task is to find the **largest possible square area** that can be formed from the **overlapping region of any two rectangles**.

If no overlap exists that can form a square, return `0`.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input**
```python
bl = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]]
tr = [[3,3],[4,4],[5,3]]
````

**Explanation**

* Rectangle 0 & 1 overlap in a region
* The largest square side from overlap = `1`
* Area = `1 × 1 = 1`

**Output**

```python
1
```

## 🧠 Approach

### Key Insight

For **each pair of rectangles**:

1. Compute overlap boundaries:

   * `minX = max(left edges)`
   * `maxX = min(right edges)`
   * `minY = max(bottom edges)`
   * `maxY = min(top edges)`
2. If valid overlap exists:

   * Overlap width = `maxX - minX`
   * Overlap height = `maxY - minY`
3. The **largest square** inside the overlap has side:

   ```
   min(width, height)
   ```
4. Track the maximum square side across all pairs
5. Return side²

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def largestSquareArea(self, bl: List[List[int]], tr: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        s = 0
        n = len(bl)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                minX = max(bl[i][0], bl[j][0])
                maxX = min(tr[i][0], tr[j][0])
                minY = max(bl[i][1], bl[j][1])
                maxY = min(tr[i][1], tr[j][1])

                if minX < maxX and minY < maxY:
                    length = min(maxX - minX, maxY - minY)
                    s = max(s, length)

        return s * s
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)` — checking all rectangle pairs
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — constant extra space

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* No overlapping rectangles → return `0`
* Overlap exists but only as a line (zero area)
* Multiple overlapping pairs → choose maximum square
* Rectangles of different sizes
