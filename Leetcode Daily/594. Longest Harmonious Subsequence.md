\# Longest Harmonious Subsequence



\## 🧩 Problem Statement



Given an integer array `nums`, return the \*\*length of the longest harmonious subsequence\*\* of the array.



A \*\*harmonious subsequence\*\* is a subsequence where the \*\*difference between its maximum and minimum elements is exactly 1\*\*.



> Note: A subsequence is formed by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

\## ✅ Solution



This solution uses a \*\*frequency map\*\* to count occurrences of each number in the array, and then checks for each number `x` whether `x - 1` exists. If so, the sum of the counts of `x` and `x - 1` is a candidate for the longest harmonious subsequence.

\### 🔹 Strategy



1\. Count the frequency of each number using `collections.Counter`.

2\. For each key `x` in the frequency map:

&nbsp;  - Check if `x - 1` is also in the map.

&nbsp;  - If yes, update the maximum length with `freq\[x] + freq\[x - 1]`.

3\. Return the maximum length found.

\### 🧑‍💻 Code



```python

from typing import List

from collections import Counter



class Solution:

&nbsp;   def findLHS(self, nums: List\[int]) -> int:

&nbsp;       n = len(nums)

&nbsp;       if n == 1:

&nbsp;           return 0

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       freq = Counter(nums)

&nbsp;       if len(freq) == 1:

&nbsp;           return 0

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       maxLen = 0

&nbsp;       for x, f in freq.items():

&nbsp;           if x - 1 in freq:

&nbsp;               maxLen = max(maxLen, f + freq\[x - 1])

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       return maxLen
