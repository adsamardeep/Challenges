# Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is ≤ K

## 🧩 Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, partition the array into the **minimum number of subsequences** such that the **difference between the maximum and minimum** element in each subsequence is **at most `k`**.

Each element must belong to exactly one subsequence.

Return the minimum number of such subsequences (partitions).

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 2, 5], k = 2  
Output: 2  
Explanation:
- One valid partition is [1, 2, 3] and [5, 6]
- The max difference within each group is ≤ 2
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def partitionArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        ans = 1
        min_val = nums[0]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            if num - min_val > k:
                ans += 1
                min_val = num
        return ans
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n \log n) \) due to sorting the array.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \) extra space (excluding input and output).

---

## 📝 Notes

- Sorting the array ensures that we can group elements greedily based on their difference.
- A new group is started every time the current number exceeds the allowed `k` difference from the minimum of the current group.
- The algorithm is efficient and optimal for minimizing the number of groups.
