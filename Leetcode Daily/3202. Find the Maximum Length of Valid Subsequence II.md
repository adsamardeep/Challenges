# ðŸ”¢ Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence II (with Modulo Transitions)

This repository contains a Python solution to an advanced variant of the valid subsequence problem where elements in the subsequence must maintain a consistent modulo transition pattern.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Overview

Given:
- A list of integers `nums`
- An integer `k`

### Task:
Find the **maximum length** of a subsequence such that for every consecutive pair of elements `a` and `b` in the subsequence, the **remainder when divided by `k` alternates** consistently (i.e., if `a % k = r1` and `b % k = r2`, then this (r1, r2) transition is maintained throughout).

---

## ðŸ’¡ Intuition

This is a generalization of the parity-based subsequence problem (modulo 2), extended to modulo `k`.

We track sequences using a dynamic programming table `dp[r1][r2]`, where:
- `dp[r1][r2]` is the length of the longest subsequence that last saw a transition from `r1 â†’ r2`.

---

## ðŸš€ Approach

1. **Initialize a `k Ã— k` DP table** to track longest transitions between remainders.
2. Iterate through `nums`, for each:
   - Compute `rem = num % k`
   - For each possible previous remainder `prev_rem`:
     - Try extending an existing sequence ending in transition `rem â†’ prev_rem` by forming `prev_rem â†’ rem`
     - Update `dp[prev_rem][rem]` = `dp[rem][prev_rem] + 1`
3. Keep track of the **maximum value** in the DP table.

## ðŸ’» Code Example

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create a 2D DP table to track remainder transitions
        dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(k)]  # dp[prev_rem][curr_rem]
        maxLength = 0

        # Step 2: Loop through each number in the array
        for num in nums:
            current_rem = num % k

            # Step 3: Try to extend existing sequences
            for prev_rem in range(k):
                # Step 4: Update the DP table if a transition is possible
                dp[prev_rem][current_rem] = dp[current_rem][prev_rem] + 1

                # Step 5: Track the longest subsequence found so far
                maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[prev_rem][current_rem])

        # Step 6: Return the maximum length found
        return maxLength

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maximumLength([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))  # Output: 4
print(sol.maximumLength([3, 6, 9, 12], 3))   # Output: 3
```

## ðŸ§  Notes

- This solution effectively models a **graph of remainder transitions**.
- It tracks not values themselves, but how they relate mod `k`, allowing for efficient O(nÂ·k) processing.
