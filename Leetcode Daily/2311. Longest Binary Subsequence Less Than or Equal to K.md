# Longest Subsequence With Limited Binary Value

## üß© Problem Description

Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, return the **length of the longest subsequence** of `s` such that:

- The subsequence represents a **binary number** (with no leading zeros except for "0"), and
- The **decimal value** of this binary number is **less than or equal to `k`**.

You may delete any number of characters from `s` to form the subsequence, but you must maintain the order of remaining characters.

### Example
```python
Input: s = "1001010", k = 5  
Output: 5  
Explanation: The longest valid subsequence is "00010" ‚Üí value = 2.
```

## üêç Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        zeros = s.count('0')  # All zeros are valid (value stays 0)
        ones = 0              # Count of valid '1's
        value = 0             # Value of the chosen subsequence
        power = 1             # Tracks binary place value

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == '1':
                if value + power > k:
                    continue  # Skip if adding this '1' exceeds limit
                value += power
                ones += 1
            power <<= 1  # Move to next binary digit (i.e., √ó2)
            if power > k:
                break     # Further bits will exceed value anyway

        return zeros + ones
```

## ‚úÖ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(1) \), constant space is used.

## üìù Notes

- The algorithm greedily selects `'1'` characters from right to left (least significant to most significant bits), as smaller bits have less impact on the value.
- All `'0'` characters can always be included since they don‚Äôt increase the value.
- Once the power of 2 exceeds `k`, we stop checking further, as any additional `'1'` will always exceed the limit.
