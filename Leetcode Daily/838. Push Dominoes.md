# Push Dominoes

## Problem Description

There is a row of dominoes represented by a string `dominoes`, where each character is:
- `'L'`: a domino falling to the left,
- `'R'`: a domino falling to the right,
- `'.'`: a standing domino.

Each domino can only be pushed by adjacent dominoes falling toward it. The dominoes push simultaneously, and your task is to return the final state of the dominoes after all forces have been applied.

### Example

**Input:**  
`dominoes = ".L.R...LR..L.."`  

**Output:**  
`"LL.RR.LLRRLL.."`

## Approach

The solution simulates the domino effect in a single left-to-right pass by tracking:
- The most recent `'R'` seen (`last_right`)
- The most recent `'L'` seen (`last_left`)

Key logic:
- When an `'R'` is encountered, all standing dominoes since the last `'R'` are pushed right.
- When an `'L'` is encountered:
  - If a previous `'R'` exists, the dominoes between are filled with opposing forces (`'R'` from left, `'L'` from right).
  - Otherwise, dominoes fall left from the last `'L'`.
- After the loop, any remaining standing dominoes to the right of the last `'R'` are pushed right.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def pushDominoes(self, dominoes: str) -> str:
        dominoes = list(dominoes)
        n = len(dominoes)
        last_right = -1
        last_left = 0

        for i, d in enumerate(dominoes):
            if d == 'R':
                if last_right != -1:
                    for j in range(last_right + 1, i):
                        dominoes[j] = 'R'
                last_right = i
            elif d == 'L':
                if last_right != -1:
                    l, r = last_right + 1, i - 1
                    while l < r:
                        dominoes[l], dominoes[r] = 'R', 'L'
                        l += 1
                        r -= 1
                    last_right = -1
                else:
                    for j in range(last_left, i):
                        dominoes[j] = 'L'
                last_left = i

        if last_right != -1:
            for i in range(last_right + 1, n):
                dominoes[i] = 'R'

        return ''.join(dominoes)
```
