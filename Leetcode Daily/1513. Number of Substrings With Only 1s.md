# 🏷 Count Substrings of Consecutive '1's (sum of k*(k+1)/2 per block)

# 📜 Problem Statement
Given a binary string `s`, count the number of substrings that consist only of the character `'1'`. Each contiguous block of `k` ones contributes `k*(k+1)/2` such substrings. The implementation also attempts to apply a modulus `10^9+7` to each block-sum.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output
Input:
```

s = "111"

```
Output:
```

6

Explanation: Substrings are "1" (x3), "11" (x2), "111" (x1) → total 6.

# 🧠 Approach
1. Scan the string left to right and maintain a running `count` of consecutive `'1'` characters.
2. When a `'0'` is encountered (or at the end of the string), convert the current block of `count` ones into the number of substrings using the formula `count * (count + 1) // 2` and add it to the accumulator `ans`. Then reset `count` to zero.
3. Continue until the end and add the last block if the string ends with `'1'`.
4. The code computes each block contribution modulo `1e9+7` individually (though the final `ans` is not reduced by `mod` before returning).

# 💻 Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        mod = int(10 ** 9 + 7)
        ans = 0

        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if(s[i] == "1"):
                count += 1
            else:
                ans += ((count * (count + 1)) // 2) % mod
                count = 0
        
        ans += ((count * (count + 1)) // 2) % mod
        
        return ans

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n = len(s)`, a single pass over the string.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — only a few integer counters are used.

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* `s = ""` (empty string) → returns `0`.
* `s` consists entirely of `'1'` → returns `n*(n+1)/2`.
* `s` consists entirely of `'0'` → returns `0`.
* Very long runs of `'1'` → Python handles large integers, but note the code applies `mod` to each block's contribution but does not reduce the running `ans` by `mod` before returning (so the final `ans` may exceed `mod` unless the caller expects it). If a full modular result is required, apply `ans %= mod` before returning.
