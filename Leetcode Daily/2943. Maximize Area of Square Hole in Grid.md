# 🏷 Maximum Area of a Square Hole in a Grid

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given an `n × m` grid with horizontal and vertical bars removed.

- `hBars`: indices of removed **horizontal** bars
- `vBars`: indices of removed **vertical** bars

Removing **consecutive bars** creates a larger gap.  
Your goal is to find the **maximum possible square hole area** that can be formed using these gaps.

---

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input**
```python
n = 5
m = 5
hBars = [1, 2]
vBars = [2]
````

**Explanation**

* Longest consecutive horizontal bars = 2 → height = 3
* Longest consecutive vertical bars = 1 → width = 2
* Largest square side = `min(3, 2) = 2`

**Output**

```python
4
```

---

## 🧠 Approach

### Key Insight

* Removing `k` **consecutive bars** creates a gap of size `k + 1`
* To form a **square**, both height and width must be equal
* Therefore:

  ```
  side = min(max_horizontal_gap, max_vertical_gap)
  area = side²
  ```

### Steps

1. Sort the bar indices
2. Find the longest streak of **consecutive indices**
3. Convert streak length to gap size (`streak + 1`)
4. Take the minimum of horizontal and vertical gaps
5. Square it to get the area

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeSquareHoleArea(self, n: int, m: int, hBars: list[int], vBars: list[int]) -> int:
        def maxSpan(bars: list[int]) -> int:
            bars.sort()
            res = 1
            streak = 1
            for i in range(1, len(bars)):
                if bars[i] - bars[i - 1] == 1:
                    streak += 1
                else:
                    streak = 1
                res = max(res, streak)
            return res + 1
        
        return min(maxSpan(hBars), maxSpan(vBars)) ** 2
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(H log H + V log V)`

  * Sorting horizontal and vertical bars
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (in-place operations)

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* No bars removed → smallest square area = `1`
* Bars removed but non-consecutive
* Only one direction has large gaps
* Single bar removal
