# Three Consecutive Odds

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `arr`, return `True` if there are **three consecutive odd numbers** in the array. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Example

**Input:**  
`arr = [2, 6, 4, 1, 3, 5]`

**Output:**  
`True`

**Explanation:**  
The subarray `[1, 3, 5]` consists of three consecutive odd numbers.

### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## Approach

Loop through the array and check every group of three consecutive elements:
- If all three elements in any group are odd (`num % 2 == 1`), return `True`.
- If the loop completes without finding such a group, return `False`.

This is a simple sliding window approach with a fixed window size of 3.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr):
        for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
            if arr[i] % 2 == 1 and arr[i+1] % 2 == 1 and arr[i+2] % 2 == 1:
                return True
        return False
```
