# K-th Character in Special Generated String

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given a special string generation rule:

1. Start with a single character `'a'`.
2. For each character in the current string, append the **next character** in the alphabet to the end of the string.
   - `'a'` → `'b'`
   - `'b'` → `'c'`
   - ...
   - `'z'` → `'a'` (wrap around)

Given an integer `k`, return the **k-th character** (1-based index) of the string generated following this rule.

## ✅ Solution

### 🔹 Strategy

1. Start with a list initialized with `'a'`.
2. While the list’s length is less than `k`, iterate over its current characters:
   - For each character, compute the **next alphabet character** (wrapping from `'z'` to `'a'`) and append it.
3. Once the string reaches length ≥ `k`, return the `k`-th character (0-based index: `k - 1`).

### 🧑‍💻 Code

```python
class Solution:
    def kthCharacter(self, k: int) -> str:
        sb = ['a']
        while len(sb) < k:
            size = len(sb)
            for i in range(size):
                next_char = chr(ord('a') + ((ord(sb[i]) - ord('a') + 1) % 26))
                sb.append(next_char)
        return sb[k - 1]
