# Max Difference of Digit Frequencies in Substrings

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits `'0'` to `'4'` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the **maximum difference** between the frequency of one digit `a` and another digit `b` (where `a ≠ b`), over all substrings of `s` of length at least `k`, with the additional condition that digit `b` must occur **at least twice** in the substring.

The result should maximize:  
`freq(a) - freq(b)` over all valid substrings of length ≥ `k`  
Only digits `0` through `4` are considered.

### Example

Input:  
`s = "1202101210"`, `k = 3`

Output:  
*(Depends on digit frequency comparisons; result is an integer)*

## Python Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def maxDfromAtoB(self, a: int, b: int, k: int, n: int, freq: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        cnt = float('-inf')
        MOD = 10 ** 8
        minFreq = [[MOD, MOD], [MOD, MOD]]
        freqA = 0
        freqB = 0
        prevA = 0
        prevB = 0
        l = 0
        for r in range(k - 1, n):
            freqA = freq[a][r + 1]
            freqB = freq[b][r + 1]
            while r - l + 1 >= k and freqB - prevB >= 2:
                minFreq[prevA & 1][prevB & 1] = min(minFreq[prevA & 1][prevB & 1], prevA - prevB)
                prevA = freq[a][l + 1]
                prevB = freq[b][l + 1]
                l += 1
            cnt = max(cnt, freqA - freqB - minFreq[1 - (freqA & 1)][freqB & 1])
        return cnt

    def maxDifference(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        freq = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(5)]
        conter = Counter(s)
        for i in range(n):
            for d in range(5):
                freq[d][i + 1] = freq[d][i]
            freq[int(s[i])][i + 1] += 1
        ans = float('-inf')
        for a in range(5):
            if freq[a][n] == 0:
                continue
            for b in range(5):
                if a == b or freq[b][n] == 0:
                    continue
                ans = max(ans, self.maxDfromAtoB(a, b, k, n, freq))
        return ans
```

## How It Works

1. **Prefix Frequency Table**: `freq[d][i]` stores how many times digit `d` appears in the prefix `s[:i]`.
2. **Two-Digit Comparison**: For each digit pair `(a, b)` where `a ≠ b`, find the maximum difference `freq(a) - freq(b)` in substrings of length ≥ `k` where digit `b` appears at least twice.
3. **Sliding Window with Parity Optimization**:
   - Keeps track of minimal previous `(freq[a] - freq[b])` combinations split by parity.
   - Uses these to efficiently find the max difference in linear time over all valid substrings.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × d²), where `n` is the length of the string and `d = 5` (digits 0–4).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n × d), for storing prefix frequency arrays.

This optimized solution avoids brute-force substring scanning and efficiently computes maximum differences using prefix sums and clever tracking by parity.
