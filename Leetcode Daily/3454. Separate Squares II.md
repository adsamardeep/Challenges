# 🏷 Separate Squares (Sweep Line + Area Accumulation)

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given multiple **axis-aligned squares** on a 2D plane.  
Each square is represented as `[x, y, l]`, where:
- `(x, y)` is the bottom-left corner
- `l` is the side length

Your task is to find the **y-coordinate of a horizontal line** such that the total **union area** of square regions **below the line** equals the area **above the line**.

Return the y-coordinate as a floating-point number.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,2]]
````

**Output (example):**

```python
1.5
```

*(Exact value depends on square overlap and layout)*

## 🧠 Approach

This solution uses a **sweep line algorithm along the y-axis**, accurately handling **overlapping squares**.

### Key Ideas:

1. **Events on Y-axis**

   * Each square contributes:

     * `(y, +1, x1, x2)` → square starts
     * `(y + l, -1, x1, x2)` → square ends

2. **Vertical Sweeping**

   * Sort events by y
   * Between consecutive y-levels, maintain active x-intervals
   * Compute **union length** of x-intervals to get horizontal coverage

3. **Area Strips**

   * For each vertical strip:

     ```
     area = height × union_width
     ```
   * Store `(start_y, height, width)`

4. **Find Half Area**

   * Accumulate strip areas
   * Once half of total area is reached, interpolate inside the strip:

     ```
     y + (remaining_area / width)
     ```

This method guarantees correctness even with **overlapping squares**, unlike simpler binary-search approaches.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def separateSquares(self, squares: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        events = []
        for x, y, l in squares:
            events.append((y, 1, x, x + l))
            events.append((y + l, -1, x, x + l))

        events.sort()
        xs = []
        prev_y = events[0][0]
        total = 0
        areas = []

        def union_len(intervals):
            intervals.sort()
            res = 0
            end = -10**30
            for a, b in intervals:
                if a > end:
                    res += b - a
                    end = b
                elif b > end:
                    res += b - end
                    end = b
            return res

        for y, typ, x1, x2 in events:
            if y > prev_y and xs:
                h = y - prev_y
                w = union_len(xs)
                areas.append((prev_y, h, w))
                total += h * w

            if typ == 1:
                xs.append((x1, x2))
            else:
                xs.remove((x1, x2))

            prev_y = y

        half = total / 2
        acc = 0

        for y, h, w in areas:
            if acc + h * w >= half:
                return y + (half - acc) / w
            acc += h * w

        return 0.0
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n² log n)` (interval merging per strip)
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Fully overlapping squares
* Disjoint squares
* Single square
* Multiple strips with zero width
* Large coordinate values
