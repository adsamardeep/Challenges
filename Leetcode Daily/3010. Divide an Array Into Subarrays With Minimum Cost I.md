# 🏷 Minimum Cost to Pick Three Smallest Elements

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a list of integers `A`.  
Your task is to compute the **minimum possible cost**, defined as the **sum of the three smallest elements** in the list.

The solution must efficiently identify the three smallest values and return their sum.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input**
```python
A = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
````

**Output**

```python
6
```

**Explanation**

* The three smallest elements are `1, 2, 3`
* Their sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

## 🧠 Approach

This solution uses a **partial selection sort** strategy:

1. It iterates only for indices `1` and `2`.
2. In each iteration, it finds the smallest element from the remaining unsorted portion.
3. Swaps it into its correct position.
4. After two passes, the first three elements of the array are guaranteed to be the three smallest.
5. Return the sum of the first three elements.

This avoids fully sorting the array, making it more efficient than a complete sort.

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(1, 3):
            m = i
            for j in range(i + 1, len(A)):
                if A[j] < A[m]:
                    m = j
            A[i], A[m] = A[m], A[i]

        return A[0] + A[1] + A[2]
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  (Two linear scans over the array)
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  (In-place swaps, no extra memory)

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Array already sorted
* Array with duplicate values
* Negative numbers included
* Minimum allowed array size (length ≥ 3)
