# 🏷 Maximum value from at most two non-overlapping events

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given a list of events where each event is represented as `[start, end, value]`, determine the maximum total value you can obtain by attending **at most two non-overlapping events**. Two events are non-overlapping if the first event ends strictly before the second one starts.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
events = [[1,3,4], [2,4,1], [3,5,2], [6,7,4]]
````

**Output:**

```python
8
```

**Explanation:**
Attend the event `[1,3,4]` and then `[6,7,4]`. They do not overlap, and their total value is `4 + 4 = 8`.

## 🧠 Approach

1. Convert each event into two timeline points:

   * A start point `(start_time, isEnd=False, value)`,
   * An end point `(end_time, isEnd=True, value)`.
2. Sort all timeline points by time. Because `False < True`, start points at the same time are processed before end points.
3. Traverse the timeline:

   * Maintain `maxV`, the maximum value of any event that has already ended.
   * When encountering a start point, compute a candidate answer as `maxV + value` (taking this event as the second one).
   * When encountering an end point, update `maxV` with the event’s value.
4. Track the maximum such sum over all start points.

This effectively considers every event as a potential second event and pairs it with the best compatible earlier event.

## 💻 Code 

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxTwoEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(events)
        Time = [(0, 0, 0)] * (n * 2)
        for i, (s, e, v) in enumerate(events):
            Time[2 * i] = (s, False, v)
            Time[2 * i + 1] = (e, True, v)
        Time.sort()
        ans, maxV = 0, 0
        for t, isEnd, v in Time:
            if isEnd:
                maxV = max(maxV, v)
            else:
                ans = max(ans, maxV + v)
        return ans
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity: **O(n log n)** due to sorting `2n` timeline points.
* Space complexity: **O(n)** for storing the timeline array.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Only one event → result is the value of that event.
* All events overlap → result is the maximum single event value.
* Events with the same start or end times → handled correctly by timeline ordering.
* Empty event list → returns `0`.
* Events with zero value → does not affect the maximum result.
