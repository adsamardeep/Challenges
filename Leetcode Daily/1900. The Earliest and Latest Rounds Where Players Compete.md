# 🏆 Earliest and Latest Rounds for Players to Meet

This repository contains a Python implementation that determines the **earliest and latest round** in which two players can meet in a single-elimination tournament.

---

## 📘 Problem Overview

You are given:
- An integer `n`, representing `n` players (labeled from `1` to `n`)
- Two integers `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer`

Players are paired up each round in order, and the winners continue to the next round. The exact outcomes of other matchups are unknown and can vary. You must compute:

- The **earliest** round in which `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` can possibly meet
- The **latest** round in which they might meet, considering all valid match outcomes

---

## 🚀 Features

- Recursive backtracking with **memoization**
- Handles symmetry and reduces redundant computations
- Efficient pruning for small tournament sizes
- Simulates all valid advancement combinations

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Strategy

1. **Normalization**: Always position `p1 < p2` for consistent symmetry.
2. **Base Case**:
   - If `p1 + p2 == n + 1`, players meet directly → round 1.
   - If `n <= 4`, small tournament → fixed round (2).
3. **Recursive Simulation**:
   - Split players into halves (next round size `m`).
   - Simulate all valid paths where both `p1` and `p2` win until they meet.
   - Use symmetry to reduce state space.
4. **Track Minimum and Maximum Rounds** across all simulations.

## 💻 Code Example

```python
class Solution:
    def earliestAndLatest(self, n: int, firstPlayer: int, secondPlayer: int) -> list[int]:
        def dfs(n, p1, p2):
            if p1 + p2 == n + 1:
                return (1, 1)
            if p1 > p2:
                p1, p2 = p2, p1
            if n <= 4:
                return (2, 2)

            m = (n + 1) // 2
            minR, maxR = float('inf'), float('-inf')

            if p1 - 1 > n - p2:
                t = n + 1 - p1
                p1 = n + 1 - p2
                p2 = t

            if p2 * 2 <= n + 1:
                a = p1 - 1
                b = p2 - p1 - 1
                for i in range(a + 1):
                    for j in range(b + 1):
                        r1, r2 = dfs(m, i + 1, i + j + 2)
                        minR = min(minR, r1 + 1)
                        maxR = max(maxR, r2 + 1)
            else:
                p4 = n + 1 - p2
                a = p1 - 1
                b = p4 - p1 - 1
                c = p2 - p4 - 1
                for i in range(a + 1):
                    for j in range(b + 1):
                        offset = i + j + 1 + (c + 1) // 2 + 1
                        r1, r2 = dfs(m, i + 1, offset)
                        minR = min(minR, r1 + 1)
                        maxR = max(maxR, r2 + 1)

            return (minR, maxR)

        return list(dfs(n, firstPlayer, secondPlayer))

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.earliestAndLatest(11, 2, 4))  # Output: [3, 4]
