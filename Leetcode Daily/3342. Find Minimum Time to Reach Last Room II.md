# Minimum Time to Reach Bottom-Right Cell with Alternating Move Costs

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D grid `moveTime` of size `n x m`. Each cell `moveTime[i][j]` represents the **earliest time** at which you are allowed to step into that cell.

You begin at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` at time `0`, and your goal is to reach the bottom-right cell `(n - 1, m - 1)`.

**Rules:**
- Each move direction (up, down, left, right) is allowed.
- Each step takes **1 or 2 units of time**, depending on the number of moves made so far:
  - If the current number of moves is even, the next step takes **1** unit of time.
  - If the number of moves is odd, the next step takes **2** units of time.
- You may not enter a cell before its corresponding `moveTime` value.

Return the **minimum total time** required to reach the bottom-right cell. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Example

**Input:**
```python
moveTime = [
  [0, 1],
  [2, 3]
]
```

**Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- Start at (0,0) at time 0.
- First move is to (0,1) at time 1 (even move → cost 1, allowed at t=1).
- Second move to (1,1) is odd (→ cost 2), but must wait until t=3, so arrive at t=5.

## Approach

This solution uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** to simulate a modified Dijkstra's algorithm:
- Each heap entry is a tuple: `(current_time, move_count, row, col)`
- Move times alternate between 1 and 2 based on the number of steps taken.
- A visited matrix is used to avoid reprocessing cells.

The heap always expands the state with the lowest total time first, guaranteeing an optimal solution when the target cell is reached.

## Python Solution

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minTimeToReach(self, moveTime):
        n, m = len(moveTime), len(moveTime[0])
        vis = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        heap = [(0, 0, 0, 0)]  # (time, moves, row, col)
        vis[0][0] = True
        dirs = [(0,1), (1,0), (-1,0), (0,-1)]

        while heap:
            time, moves, r, c = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if r == n - 1 and c == m - 1:
                return time
            for dr, dc in dirs:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and not vis[nr][nc]:
                    vis[nr][nc] = True
                    wait = max(time, moveTime[nr][nc])
                    travel_time = 1 if moves % 2 == 0 else 2
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (wait + travel_time, moves + 1, nr, nc))
        return -1
```
