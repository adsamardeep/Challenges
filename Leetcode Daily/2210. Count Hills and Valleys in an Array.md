# countHillValley - Count Hills and Valleys in an Array

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. A **hill** is a number that is **strictly greater** than its immediate neighbors. A **valley** is a number that is **strictly less** than its immediate neighbors.

Your task is to return the **total number of hills and valleys** in the array. Note that if two or more adjacent elements are equal, they are treated as a **single plateau** and skipped when comparing.

### âœ… Example
```python
Input:  nums = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5]
Output: 3

# Explanation:
# - 4 is a hill (2 < 4 > 1)
# - 1 is a valley (4 > 1 < 6)
# - 6 is a hill (1 < 6 > 5)
```

```python
Input: nums = [6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 1]
Output: 0

# Explanation:
# No valid hills or valleys due to non-strict transitions and plateaus.
```

## ðŸ§  Approach

- Iterate through the array from `i = 1` to `len(nums) - 2`
- Track the **last distinct element index** with a `left` pointer
- At each step:
  - Skip if `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]` (plateau)
  - If `nums[i] > nums[left]` and `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`, it's a **hill**
  - If `nums[i] < nums[left]` and `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`, it's a **valley**
  - Update `left = i` after each check

## ðŸ’¡ Key Points

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) â€” single linear scan
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) â€” uses constant extra space

## ðŸ“„ Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        left = 0

        for i in range(1, len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
                if (nums[i] > nums[left] and nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) or \
                   (nums[i] < nums[left] and nums[i] < nums[i + 1]):
                    count += 1
                left = i

        return count
```

## ðŸ“‚ Usage

This function is ideal for analyzing **elevation changes**, **stock price peaks**, or any sequence where identifying **local maximums and minimums** matters â€” especially with **plateau filtering** for cleaner results.
