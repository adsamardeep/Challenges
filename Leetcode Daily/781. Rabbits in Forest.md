# 🐇 Rabbits in the Forest

## 📝 Problem Description

In a forest, each rabbit tells you how many **other** rabbits have the same color as it. Each rabbit gives a number `x`, which means there are `x` other rabbits of the same color (so a total of `x + 1` rabbits of that color).

You're given an integer array `answers`, where each element is a rabbit's answer. Return the **minimum number of rabbits** that could be in the forest based on these answers.

### Example

```text
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
```
Explanation:
- Two rabbits say "1" → they can be from the same group of 2 rabbits.
- One rabbit says "2" → needs a group of 3 rabbits.
- Minimum rabbits = 2 + 3 = 5

## 💡 Solution (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers):
        answers.sort()
        res = 0
        count = 0

        for i in range(len(answers)):
            if answers[i] == 0:
                res += 1  
            elif i == 0 or answers[i] != answers[i - 1] or count == 0:
                res += answers[i] + 1  
                count = answers[i]
            else:
                count -= 1 
        return res
```
