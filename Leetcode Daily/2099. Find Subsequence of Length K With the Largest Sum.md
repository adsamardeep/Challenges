\#Max Subsequence of Length k



\## 🧩 Problem Statement



Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the \*\*subsequence of length `k`\*\* that has the \*\*largest sum\*\*. If there are multiple such subsequences, return the one that \*\*appears in the same relative order\*\* as in the original array.



A \*\*subsequence\*\* is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

\## ✅ Solution



This solution works by:

1\. \*\*Pairing each number with its index\*\* to preserve the original order.

2\. \*\*Sorting the list by value in descending order\*\* to find the `k` largest elements.

3\. \*\*Selecting the top `k` elements\*\* and then \*\*sorting them back by their original indices\*\* to maintain their relative order in the original array.

4\. \*\*Extracting the values\*\* from the sorted pairs to get the final result.

```python

from typing import List



class Solution:

&nbsp;   def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List\[int], k: int) -> List\[int]:

&nbsp;       # Pair with indices

&nbsp;       nums\_with\_indices = \[(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       # Sort by value descending

&nbsp;       nums\_with\_indices.sort(key=lambda x: -x\[0])

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       # Take top k and sort by original index

&nbsp;       top\_k = sorted(nums\_with\_indices\[:k], key=lambda x: x\[1])

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       # Extract values

&nbsp;       return \[num for num, \_ in top\_k]
