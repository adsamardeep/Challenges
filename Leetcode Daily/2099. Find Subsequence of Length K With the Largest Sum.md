# Max Subsequence of Length k

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the **subsequence of length `k`** that has the **largest sum**. If there are multiple such subsequences, return the one that **appears in the same relative order** as in the original array.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## ✅ Solution

This solution works by:
1. **Pairing each number with its index** to preserve the original order.
2. **Sorting the list by value in descending order** to find the `k` largest elements.
3. **Selecting the top `k` elements** and then **sorting them back by their original indices** to maintain their relative order in the original array.
4. **Extracting the values** from the sorted pairs to get the final result.

### 🧑‍💻 Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Pair with indices
        nums_with_indices = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]
        
        # Sort by value descending
        nums_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: -x[0])
        
        # Take top k and sort by original index
        top_k = sorted(nums_with_indices[:k], key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        # Extract values
        return [num for num, _ in top_k]
