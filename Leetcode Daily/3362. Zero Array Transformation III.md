# Max Task Removal with Time-Constrained Queries

## Problem Description

You are given:

- An integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` represents the number of tasks to remove at time `i`.
- A list of `queries` where each query is a tuple `[start, end]`. Each query represents an available worker who can process one task at any time `t` such that `start <= t <= end`.

Each worker can only be used once. Your goal is to determine whether it's possible to remove all the tasks in `nums` using the given workers. If not, return `-1`. If it's possible, return the number of **unused workers** remaining after all tasks are assigned.

### Example:

```
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 0, 1]
queries = [[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 2], [2, 3]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
- At time 0, assign query [0, 1] to task 1.
- At time 1, assign query [1, 2] and [0, 3] to 2 tasks.
- At time 3, assign query [2, 3] to 1 task.
- One worker remains unused.
```

## Python Solution

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxRemoval(self, nums, queries):
        n = len(nums)
        m = len(queries)
        workload = [0] * (n + 1)

        queries.sort()
        available = []  # Max heap via negatives
        q_index = 0

        for time in range(n):
            if time > 0:
                workload[time] += workload[time - 1]

            while q_index < m and queries[q_index][0] == time:
                heapq.heappush(available, -queries[q_index][1])
                q_index += 1

            while workload[time] < nums[time]:
                if not available or -available[0] < time:
                    return -1

                workload[time] += 1
                end_time = -heapq.heappop(available)
                if end_time + 1 < len(workload):
                    workload[end_time + 1] -= 1

        return len(available)
```
