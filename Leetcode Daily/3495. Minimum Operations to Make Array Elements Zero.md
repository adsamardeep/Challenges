# 🟩 Problem: Minimum Operations over Query Ranges (bit-length / base-4 based summation)

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a list of queries, each query is a pair [l, r] describing an integer interval.  
For each query you need to compute a value derived from a quickly-evaluable cumulative function expSum(x) and then accumulate a transformed half-value over the interval. Concretely, for each query [l, r] the implementation computes:

    diff = expSum(r) - expSum(l-1)
    add = ceil(diff / 2)

and returns the sum of add across all queries.

The implementation below computes expSum(x) very efficiently using bit-length tricks and a precomputed table expSum4, then processes all queries in O(1) time each (after precomputation).

---

## 🔍 Example (illustrative)

Input:
    queries = [[1, 3], [4, 10], [7, 7]]

Process (conceptual):
- For each query compute diff = expSum(r) - expSum(l-1).
- Add ceil(diff / 2) to the running total.

Output:
    (total ops as integer)

Note: the exact numeric output depends on the precise definition of expSum(x) (see Approach). The code below computes it as implemented.

## 🧠 Approach (overview)
1. Precompute an array expSum4 for blocks aligned to powers of 4. expSum4[k] stores the cumulative base value for all numbers x whose highest set bit group places them in the 4^k block. The precomputation loop fills expSum4 for enough k (here up to 17, which covers 64-bit ranges used by typical constraints).

2. Define expSum(x):
   - If x == 0 return 0.
   - Compute log4 = (x.bit_length() - 1) >> 1 — this finds which power-of-4 block x belongs to via bit-length arithmetic.
   - Compute the block base 1 << (log4 << 1) and the remainder r = x - base.
   - Return expSum4[log4] + r * (log4 + 1) — this yields the cumulative value for x using the precomputed base plus the additive contribution from the remainder inside the block.

   (This design keeps expSum(x) O(1) after precomputation.)

3. For every query [l, r] compute diff = expSum(r) - expSum(l-1). The contribution to the final answer is ceil(diff / 2) which the code computes as (diff + 1) >> 1. Sum these contributions for all queries and return the result.

4. Overall complexity is dominated by the O(1) per-query work after the O(1) precomputation (constant-sized loop).

## 💻 Code 
    class Solution:
        def minOperations(self, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
            expSum4 = [1] + [0] * 17

            def expSum(x):
                if x == 0:
                    return 0
                # find the 'base' 4-block via bit-length
                log4 = (x.bit_length() - 1) >> 1
                base = 1 << (log4 << 1)
                r = x - base
                return expSum4[log4] + r * (log4 + 1)

            # precompute cumulative bases for blocks of size 4^k
            for i in range(1, 18):
                expSum4[i] = expSum4[i - 1] + 3 * i * (1 << (2 * (i - 1))) + 1

            op = 0
            for l1, r in queries:
                # diff is the cumulative measure on [l1, r]
                diff = expSum(r) - expSum(l1 - 1)
                # add ceil(diff / 2)
                op += (diff + 1) >> 1

            return op

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- Precomputation: O(1) (a fixed loop up to 17 iterations — constant time).
- Per query: O(1) — computing expSum is O(1) with bit-length operations and table lookup.
- Total time: O(Q) where Q = number of queries (plus a constant precompute).
- Space: O(1) extra (the expSum4 table is constant-sized).

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases & Notes
- l can equal r (single-point intervals) — code handles it because expSum(l-1) is used correctly.
- l may be 1 — expSum(0) returns 0.
- The precomputed depth (18 entries) is chosen to safely cover typical integer ranges (64-bit). If input numbers might be extremely large, increase the table length accordingly.
- The interpretation of expSum is implementation-specific in this routine (it uses bit-length and block arithmetic). The important property is that expSum(r)-expSum(l-1) is computed in O(1) and the final contribution per query is ceil(diff/2).
