# Maximum Distance After Reversing Up to K Moves

## 🧩 Problem Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of directions (`'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'`, `'W'`) representing moves on a 2D grid starting from the origin `(0, 0)`. 

You are allowed to **reverse up to `k` moves** to maximize the **Manhattan distance** from the origin. Reversing a move means changing its direction to the opposite (e.g., `'N'` becomes `'S'`).

Return the **maximum possible Manhattan distance** from the origin after making at most `k` reversals.

### Example
```python
Input: s = "NENWS", k = 1  
Output: 5  
Explanation:
- Original path leads to a distance of 1.
- Reversing one 'S' to 'N' can add extra vertical distance.
- Max achievable distance: 5
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        x, y = 0, 0
        distances = []

        # Simulate movement and track Manhattan distances from origin
        for move in s:
            if move == "N":
                y += 1
            elif move == "S":
                y -= 1
            elif move == "E":
                x += 1
            elif move == "W":
                x -= 1
            distances.append(abs(x) + abs(y))

        if k == 0:
            return max(distances)

        max_dist = distances[1]
        previous = distances[0]
        added_boost = 0

        for i in range(1, len(distances)):
            # If distance drops, reverse the move to increase distance
            if distances[i] < previous and k > 0:
                added_boost += 2
                k -= 1
            previous = distances[i]
            distances[i] += added_boost
            max_dist = max(max_dist, distances[i])

        return max_dist
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) to store intermediate distances.

## 📝 Notes

- The algorithm simulates each move and tracks how far the point is from the origin at every step.
- When distance decreases compared to the previous step, and if reversals are available (`k > 0`), it adds an artificial "boost" to the distance.
- The "added boost" mimics the reversal of direction by increasing distance by 2 (since reversing a move both undoes and adds displacement).
- It’s a greedy simulation that incrementally applies reversals to maximize the result.
