# Longest Subsequence with Different Adjacent Groups

## Problem Description

Given:
- A list of strings `words`
- A list of integers `groups` of the same length

Each `groups[i]` represents a group ID for `words[i]`. The task is to construct the **longest subsequence** of `words` such that **no two adjacent words** in the result belong to the same group.

The subsequence must maintain the original relative order from the input list.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def getLongestSubsequence(self, words, groups):
        result = []
        last = -1
        for i in range(len(words)):
            if groups[i] != last:
                result.append(words[i])
                last = groups[i]
        return result
