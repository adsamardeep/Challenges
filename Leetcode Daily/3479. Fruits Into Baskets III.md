# 🌲 `numOfUnplacedFruits` – Efficient Fruit Placement Using Segment Tree

## 📘 Problem Statement

You are given two lists:

- `fruits` → Each element represents the **size** of a fruit.
- `baskets` → Each element represents the **capacity** of a basket.

**Goal:**  
Determine how many fruits **cannot be placed** in any basket.

### 🍽 Placement Rule:
- A fruit can be placed in a basket **if its size is ≤ basket's capacity**.
- Each basket can hold **at most one fruit**.

---

### ✅ Example

```python
Input: fruits = [2, 3, 5], baskets = [3, 4, 1]
Output: 1

# Explanation:
# - Fruit 2 → Basket 3 ✅
# - Fruit 3 → Basket 4 ✅
# - Fruit 5 → ❌ No basket available
# => 1 fruit left unplaced
```

## 🧠 Optimized Approach – Segment Tree

Instead of checking every basket for every fruit (O(n²)), we build a **Segment Tree** to:

- Store the **maximum basket capacity** in each segment.
- Allow **efficient lookup** (O(log n)) for a basket that can hold a fruit.
- Update the tree when a basket is used.

## 📄 Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits: List[int], baskets: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(baskets)
        N = 1
        while N <= n:
            N <<= 1  # Find next power of 2
        
        segTree = [0] * (2 * N)
        
        # Initialize segment tree with basket capacities
        for i in range(n):
            segTree[N + i] = baskets[i]
        for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
            segTree[i] = max(segTree[2 * i], segTree[2 * i + 1])
        
        count = 0  # unplaced fruit counter
        
        for fruit in fruits:
            index = 1
            # If no basket can hold this fruit
            if segTree[index] < fruit:
                count += 1
                continue
            
            # Traverse to the leftmost basket that can hold the fruit
            while index < N:
                if segTree[2 * index] >= fruit:
                    index = 2 * index
                else:
                    index = 2 * index + 1
            
            # Mark basket as used
            segTree[index] = -1
            # Update segment tree up to root
            while index > 1:
                index //= 2
                segTree[index] = max(segTree[2 * index], segTree[2 * index + 1])
        
        return count
```

## 🕒 Complexity

- **Time**:
  - Segment Tree Build: O(n)
  - Each fruit placement: O(log n)
  - **Total:** O(n log n)

- **Space**: O(n)  
  (For the segment tree.)

## 🧪 Edge Cases

- `fruits = [1, 2, 3], baskets = [0, 0, 0]` → All unplaced → Output: `3`
- `fruits = [], baskets = []` → No fruits to place → Output: `0`
- `fruits = [1], baskets = [1]` → Exact match → Output: `0`
