# 🏷 Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by k

# 📜 Problem Statement  
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, determine the minimum number of operations needed so that the **sum of the array becomes divisible by `k`**.  
This implementation directly returns `sum(nums) % k`, which is the minimal number of increments/decrements needed under the assumed operation model.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output  
Input:
```

nums = [2, 3, 5], k = 4

```
Output:
```

2

````
Explanation: The sum is 10, and `10 % 4 = 2`, so 2 operations are assumed to be sufficient.

# 🧠 Approach  
1. Compute the total sum of the array.  
2. The remainder `sum(nums) % k` represents the distance from the nearest multiple of `k`.  
3. Under the assumed operation definition (each operation adjusts sum by exactly 1), this remainder is the minimal number of operations required.  
4. Return this remainder directly.

# 💻 Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        return sum(nums) % k

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(n) — computing the sum of the array.
* **Space:** O(1).

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* All zeros → result is `0`.
* `k = 1` → always returns `0` since any sum is divisible by 1.
* Negative numbers do not affect correctness — Python’s `%` gives a non-negative remainder.
* Very large arrays still efficient due to O(n) summation.
