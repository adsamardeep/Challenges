# 🏷 Find the Element Repeated N Times in an Array

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given an array of size `2N` containing `N + 1` unique elements, where exactly one element is repeated `N` times. The task is to identify and return the element that is repeated.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
A = [1, 2, 3, 3]
````

**Output:**

```python
3
```

Another example:

```python
A = [5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4]
```

Output:

```python
5
```

## 🧠 Approach

1. Iterate through the array up to the third-to-last element.
2. For each index `i`, compare `A[i]` with:

   * `A[i + 1]`
   * `A[i + 2]`
3. If either comparison matches, `A[i]` must be the element repeated `N` times.
4. If no match is found during the loop, the repeated element must be the **last element** of the array.

This works because in an array of size `2N` with one element repeated `N` times, that element must appear close together somewhere.

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, A: list[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(A) - 2):
            if A[i] == A[i + 1] or A[i] == A[i + 2]:
                return A[i]
        return A[-1]
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  Single pass through the array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  No extra data structures used.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Repeated element appears mostly at the end
* Array with minimum valid size (`2`)
* Repeated values spaced apart initially but adjacent later
* All elements except one are unique
