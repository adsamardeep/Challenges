# Divide String Into Equal Groups with Padding

## 🧩 Problem Description

Given a string `s`, an integer `k`, and a character `fill`, divide the string into groups of length `k`. If the final group is shorter than `k` characters, **pad it with the `fill` character** until it reaches length `k`.

Return the resulting list of groups.

### Example
```python
Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"  
Output: ["abc", "def", "ghi"]

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 3, fill = "x"  
Output: ["abc", "def", "gxx"]
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def divideString(self, s: str, k: int, fill: str) -> list[str]:
        n = len(s)
        groups = (n + k - 1) // k  # Ceiling division to count number of groups
        result = []

        for i in range(groups):
            group = ''
            for j in range(k):
                index = i * k + j
                if index < n:
                    group += s[index]
                else:
                    group += fill  # Padding with fill character
            result.append(group)

        return result
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), for storing the output list of substrings.

## 📝 Notes

- The use of ceiling division ensures all characters are included and the last group is created even if it's incomplete.
- The inner loop carefully checks bounds to decide whether to add a character from `s` or pad with `fill`.
- This method guarantees all returned substrings are of length `k`.
