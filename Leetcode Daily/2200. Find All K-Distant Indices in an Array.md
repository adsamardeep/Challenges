# Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array

## 🧩 Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `key`, and an integer `k`.

A **k-distant index** is an index `i` such that there exists an index `j` where:

- `nums[j] == key`, and  
- `abs(i - j) <= k`

Return a list of all k-distant indices **in increasing order**.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [3, 4, 9, 1, 3, 9, 5], key = 9, k = 1  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Explanation:
- Indices 2 and 5 contain the key (9).
- All indices from 1 to 6 are within distance 1 of either 2 or 5.
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findKDistantIndices(self, nums: List[int], key: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = []
        j = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if x == key:
                up = min(n - 1, i + k)
                j = max(j, i - k)
                while j <= up:
                    ans.append(j)
                    j += 1
        return ans
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of `nums`. Each index is visited at most once in the outer and inner loops due to the optimized `j` tracking.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) in the worst case, for storing the result list.

## 📝 Notes

- This solution avoids duplicate processing by maintaining a pointer `j` to track the next starting index for appending to the result.
- Efficient handling of overlapping k-distance windows avoids redundant computation.
- Ensures that indices are appended in increasing order as required.
