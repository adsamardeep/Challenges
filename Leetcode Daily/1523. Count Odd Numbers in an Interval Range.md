# 🏷 Count Odd Numbers in an Interval

# 📜 Problem Statement
Given two integers `low` and `high` representing a (inclusive) range, return how many **odd** integers exist in that interval.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output
Input:
```

low = 3, high = 7

```
Numbers: 3,4,5,6,7 → odds are 3,5,7 → **3**

Output:
```

3

# 🧠 Approach
Let the length of the interval be `total = high - low + 1`.

- If both `low` and `high` are odd, then among these `total` numbers, the number of odd elements is `total//2 + 1`.
- Otherwise, the count is simply `total//2`.

This works because odd/even alternates. Only when both ends are odd does the interval contain one extra odd.

# 💻 Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        total = high - low + 1
        if low % 2 != 0 and high % 2 != 0:
            return total // 2 + 1
        return total // 2

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* Time: **O(1)**
* Space: **O(1)**

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* `low == high`
* Adjacent numbers (e.g., `low=2, high=3`)
* Very large bounds (still O(1))
