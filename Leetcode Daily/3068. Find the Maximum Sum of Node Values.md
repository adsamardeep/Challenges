# Maximum Value Sum After XOR Transform on Tree Nodes

## Problem Description

You are given:

- A list of integers `nums` representing the value of each node in a tree.
- An integer `k`.
- A list of edges that define the structure of the tree.

Each node's value can be optionally XOR'd with `k`, but **each node can be transformed at most once**. The goal is to **maximize the sum of all node values** after applying XOR to a subset of nodes under the constraint:

- The number of XOR-transformed nodes must be **even**, so that pairs of XORed nodes can be matched.

### Example:

```
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 1
edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]

Output:
6

Explanation:
- XORing 2 nodes (e.g. nodes 1 and 2) leads to an increased sum.
- Greedily choose pairs of nodes with the best XOR gain.
```

## Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumValueSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total = 0
        res = []
        for x in nums:
            total += x
            y = x ^ k
            res.append(y - x)
        res.sort(reverse = True)
        for i in range(0, len(res) - 1, 2):
            if res[i] + res[i + 1] <= 0:
                break
            total += res[i] + res[i + 1]
        return total
```

## Notes

- The approach works by:
  1. Computing the XOR gain for each node.
  2. Sorting the gains in descending order.
  3. Selecting the best pairs of gains to add to the total (must choose in pairs to keep the count of XORed nodes even).
