# 🏷 Determine if Last Character Is One-Bit

# 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a binary array representing characters encoded with either 1-bit (`0`) or 2-bit (`10` or `11`) patterns. Determine whether the last character in the array is a 1-bit character.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output
Input:
```

bits = [1, 0, 0]

```
Output:
```

True

````
Explanation: The encoding is `[10][0]`, so the last character is a 1-bit character.

# 🧠 Approach
1. Iterate through the array using index `i`.
2. If `bits[i] == 1`, skip two positions (2-bit character).  
   Otherwise skip one (1-bit character).
3. Stop when you reach the last index.
4. Return whether the pointer ends exactly on the last bit, meaning it's a 1-bit character.

# 💻 Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(bits)
        i = 0
        while i < n - 1:
            i += bits[i] + 1
        return i == n - 1

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) — single scan through the bits.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) — constant memory.

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* Single element `[0]` → True.
* Pattern ending with a 2-bit character (e.g., `[1,1,0,1,1]`) → False.
* Array containing only 2-bit characters except last `0`.
* Large arrays of alternating 1s and 0s.
