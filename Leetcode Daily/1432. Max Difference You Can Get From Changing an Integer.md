# Maximum Difference by Digit Replacement

## 🧩 Problem Description

Given an integer `num`, you are allowed to perform **two digit replacement operations** to create:

- A **maximum number** by replacing all occurrences of a single digit with `'9'`.
- A **minimum number** by replacing all occurrences of a single digit with `'1'` (if it’s the first digit) or `'0'` (for other digits), ensuring the result doesn't start with zero.

Return the **difference** between the maximum and minimum numbers formed from these operations.

### Example
```python
Input: num = 9288  
Output: 8700  
Explanation:
- Max: Replace '2' with '9' ⇒ 9988
- Min: Replace '8' with '0' ⇒ 1288
- Difference: 9988 - 1288 = 8700
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDiff(self, num: int) -> int:
        mx, mn = str(num), str(num)

        # Maximize by replacing the first non-'9' digit
        j = 0
        while j < len(mx) - 1 and mx[j] == '9':
            j += 1
        mx = mx.replace(mx[j], '9')

        # Minimize by replacing with '1' (if at index 0) or '0' (otherwise)
        for i in range(len(mn)):
            if i == 0:
                if mn[i] != '1':
                    mn = mn.replace(mn[i], '1')
                    break
            else:
                if mn[i] != '0' and mn[i] != mn[0]:
                    mn = mn.replace(mn[i], '0')
                    break

        return int(mx) - int(mn)
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of digits in `num`, due to string traversal and replacements.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) for storing string representations of the number.

## 📝 Notes

- This solution avoids leading zeros in the minimum number by ensuring the first digit is never replaced with `'0'`.
- The logic ensures a single digit is replaced throughout for both maximum and minimum transformations.
- Efficient use of string replacement makes the code concise and performant.
