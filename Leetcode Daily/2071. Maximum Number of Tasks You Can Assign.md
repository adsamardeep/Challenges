# Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign

## Problem Description

You are given:
- An array `tasks` where `tasks[i]` is the strength required for the `i-th` task.
- An array `workers` where `workers[j]` is the strength of the `j-th` worker.
- An integer `pills`, representing the number of available strength-boosting pills.
- An integer `strength`, the extra strength a pill adds to a worker.

You can assign **at most one task to each worker** and give a pill to a worker **at most once**. Your goal is to determine the **maximum number of tasks** you can assign such that:
- Each assigned task's required strength is less than or equal to the worker's (possibly boosted) strength.
- You do not exceed the available pills.

## Example

**Input:**  
`tasks = [3, 2, 1], workers = [0, 3, 3], pills = 1, strength = 1`  

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
You can assign all 3 tasks:
- Assign task `1` to worker `0` with a pill (0 + 1 >= 1)
- Assign task `2` to worker `1` (3 >= 2)
- Assign task `3` to worker `2` (3 >= 3)

## Approach

The problem is solved using **binary search** combined with a greedy strategy:

1. **Sort tasks and workers**.
2. **Binary search** over the number of tasks (`mid`) that could possibly be assigned.
3. For each binary search guess, attempt to assign the `mid` easiest tasks to the strongest available workers using:
   - Direct assignment if the worker's strength is enough.
   - Pills if necessary and available.

A deque is used to efficiently manage boosted workers.

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxTaskAssign(self, tasks, workers, pills, strength):
        tasks.sort()
        workers.sort()

        def can_assign(mid):
            boosted = deque()
            w = len(workers) - 1
            free_pills = pills

            for t in reversed(tasks[:mid]):
                if boosted and boosted[0] >= t:
                    boosted.popleft()
                elif w >= 0 and workers[w] >= t:
                    w -= 1
                else:
                    while w >= 0 and workers[w] + strength >= t:
                        boosted.append(workers[w])
                        w -= 1
                    if not boosted or free_pills == 0:
                        return False
                    boosted.pop()
                    free_pills -= 1
            return True

        low, high = 0, min(len(tasks), len(workers))
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
            if can_assign(mid):
                low = mid
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return low
```
