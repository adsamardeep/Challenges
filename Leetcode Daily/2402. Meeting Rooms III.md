# 🏢 Most Booked Meeting Room

This repository contains a Python implementation that solves the problem of **meeting room scheduling**, where you aim to assign meetings to rooms and determine **which room hosted the most meetings**. Meetings may be delayed if all rooms are busy, and are assigned to the lowest-indexed room available.

---

## 📘 Problem Overview

You are given:
- An integer `n` — the number of available meeting rooms labeled `0` to `n-1`
- A list of `meetings`, where each meeting is defined by a `[start, end]` time

### Objective:
- Assign each meeting to a room following these rules:
  1. If multiple rooms are free, use the one with the **lowest number**.
  2. If no rooms are free, **delay the meeting** until the **soonest** room becomes free, and assign it there.
- Track how many meetings each room hosted.
- Return the room number that hosted the **most meetings**. If there's a tie, return the **lowest-numbered** room.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Efficient scheduling using two **min-heaps**:
  - One for **free rooms**
  - One for **busy rooms** (with end times)
- Automatically handles **delayed meetings**
- Resolves **tie-breaking** by choosing the room with the lowest index

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Sort** all meetings by start time.
2. Use a **min-heap (`free_rooms`)** to store currently available room numbers.
3. Use a **min-heap (`busy`)** of tuples `(end_time, room_number)` to track ongoing meetings.
4. For each meeting:
   - Free up rooms that are available by the current start time.
   - If a room is free, assign the meeting.
   - If no room is free, delay the meeting until the soonest room is available.
5. Count how many meetings each room hosted.
6. Return the room that hosted the most meetings.

## 💻 Code Example

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        meetings.sort()
        free_rooms = list(range(n))
        heapq.heapify(free_rooms)

        busy = []
        count = [0] * n

        for start, end in meetings:
            duration = end - start

            # Free up rooms that are done
            while busy and busy[0][0] <= start:
                _, room = heapq.heappop(busy)
                heapq.heappush(free_rooms, room)

            if free_rooms:
                room = heapq.heappop(free_rooms)
                count[room] += 1
                heapq.heappush(busy, (end, room))
            else:
                free_time, room = heapq.heappop(busy)
                count[room] += 1
                heapq.heappush(busy, (free_time + duration, room))

        # Return room with most meetings (lowest index in case of tie)
        max_meetings = max(count)
        for i, c in enumerate(count):
            if c == max_meetings:
                return i

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.mostBooked(2, [[0, 10], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 4]]))  # Output: 0
