# Find Words Containing Character

## Problem Description

You are given a list of strings `words` and a character `x`. Your task is to return a list of indices of the words that contain the character `x`.

### Example:

```
Input:
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
x = "a"

Output:
[0, 1, 3]

Explanation:
- "apple", "banana", and "date" contain the character "a".
```

## Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findWordsContaining(self, words: List[str], x: str) -> List[int]:
        return [i for i, w in enumerate(words) if w.find(x) != -1]
```

## Notes

- Uses `enumerate` to access both index and word.
- Checks if `x` exists in each word using `str.find()`.
- Time Complexity: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average word length.
- Space Complexity: O(k), where `k` is the number of matched indices.

Simple and efficient for small to moderately sized input lists.
