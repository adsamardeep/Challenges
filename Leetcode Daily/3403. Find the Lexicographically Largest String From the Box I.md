# Lexicographically Greatest Substring With Friends

## Problem Description

Given a string `word` and an integer `numFriends`, the task is to determine the **lexicographically greatest substring** of length `len(word) - numFriends + 1` that can be formed. 

This represents a scenario where you are forming an answer string collaboratively with `numFriends` total people, and you must select the substring that gives the lexicographically greatest result.

### Constraints:

- If `numFriends == 1`, the whole word is returned.
- Otherwise, the returned substring must be of length `len(word) - numFriends + 1`.
- Among all such possible substrings, return the one that is lexicographically greatest.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def answerString(self, word, numFriends):
        """
        :type word: str
        :type numFriends: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if numFriends == 1:
            return word

        n = len(word)
        length = n - numFriends + 1
        max_char = max(word)
        result = ""

        for i in range(n):
            if word[i] == max_char:
                substr = word[i:i + length]
                result = max(result, substr)

        return result
