# Count Subarrays With Average Less Than K

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the **average of the subarray is strictly less than `k`**.

### Example

**Input:**  
`nums = [2, 1, 4, 3], k = 4`  

**Output:**  
`6`

**Explanation:**  
The valid subarrays with average less than 4 are:  
- [2]  
- [1]  
- [4]  
- [3]  
- [2, 1]  
- [1, 4]

## Approach

To solve this efficiently, a sliding window approach is used. The key insight is that a subarray's average is less than `k` if:

```
(part_sum / length) < k
```

This can be rearranged to avoid floating-point operations:

```
part_sum * length < k * length
```

We maintain a running sum `part_sum` and use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to track the bounds of the current window. If the condition fails, we move `left` forward and subtract from `part_sum` accordingly.

## Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        res = part_sum = 0
        left = 0

        for right, num in enumerate(nums):
            part_sum += num
            while part_sum * (right - left + 1) >= k * (right - left + 1):
                part_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            res += right - left + 1

        return res
```
