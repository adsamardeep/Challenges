# Make Two Arrays Equal by Minimizing Sum with Zeros

## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length. Some elements in these arrays may be `0`, which are considered as **wildcards** that can be replaced with any **positive integer** (greater than zero).

Your task is to determine the **minimum possible equal sum** that can be obtained by filling the zeros in both arrays **such that the total sum of each array is equal**.

### Rules:
- You may only fill zeros with **positive integers**.
- If it is impossible to make the sums equal under these constraints, return `-1`.
- Otherwise, return the **minimum equal sum** that can be achieved.

### Example

**Input:**
```python
nums1 = [0, 1, 2]
nums2 = [1, 1, 2]
```

**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**  
- Fill the `0` in `nums1` with `1`, so it becomes `[1, 1, 2]` → sum is `4`
- `nums2` is already `[1, 1, 2]` → sum is `4`
- Sums are equal and minimized.

### Edge Case:
If both arrays have no zeros and their sums are different, return `-1`.

## Approach

1. **Count zeros and compute the sum** of each array.
2. Handle three cases:
   - No zeros in either array: Check if their sums are equal.
   - One array has zeros: Check if the other sum can be matched with the smallest possible values (fill all zeros with 1).
   - Both arrays have zeros: Return the maximum of the two minimum possible sums (`sum + zero_count`), as we can freely adjust both sides.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minSum(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        sum1, sum2 = 0, 0
        zeros1, zeros2 = 0, 0

        for num in nums1:
            if num == 0:
                zeros1 += 1
            sum1 += num

        for num in nums2:
            if num == 0:
                zeros2 += 1
            sum2 += num

        if zeros1 == 0 and zeros2 == 0:
            return sum1 if sum1 == sum2 else -1
        elif zeros1 == 0:
            return sum1 if sum2 + zeros2 <= sum1 else -1
        elif zeros2 == 0:
            return sum2 if sum1 + zeros1 <= sum2 else -1

        return max(sum1 + zeros1, sum2 + zeros2)
```
