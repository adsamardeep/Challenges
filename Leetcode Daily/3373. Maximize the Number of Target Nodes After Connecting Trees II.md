# Max Target Nodes in Two Trees Based on Bipartite Coloring

## Problem Description

You are given two **trees** represented by:
- `edges1`: list of undirected edges for the first tree with `n + 1` nodes,
- `edges2`: list of undirected edges for the second tree with `m + 1` nodes.

Each tree is bipartite (i.e., can be 2-colored such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color).

**Goal:**
For each node `i` in the first tree, return the number of nodes that can be targeted based on:
- The number of nodes in the same color group as node `i` in the first tree,
- Plus the maximum-sized color group from the second tree.

### Example:

```
Input:
edges1 = [[0,1],[1,2]]
edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2]]

Output:
[4, 3, 4]

Explanation:
- Tree 1 bipartition: group sizes [2, 1]
- Tree 2 bipartition: group sizes [2, 1]
- max color group in tree 2 = 2
- For node i in tree 1, result = size of node i's group in tree1 + 2
```

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution(object):
    def buildGraph(self, edges, size):
        graph = [[] for _ in range(size)]
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        return graph

    def bfs(self, graph):
        n = len(graph)
        color_count = [0, 0]
        node_color = [0] * n
        visited = [False] * n
        queue = deque([(0, 0)])
        visited[0] = True

        while queue:
            node, color = queue.popleft()
            node_color[node] = color
            color_count[color] += 1

            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append((neighbor, 1 - color))

        return color_count, node_color

    def maxTargetNodes(self, edges1, edges2):
        n = len(edges1) + 1
        m = len(edges2) + 1

        tree1 = self.buildGraph(edges1, n)
        tree2 = self.buildGraph(edges2, m)

        color1, node_color1 = self.bfs(tree1)
        color2, _ = self.bfs(tree2)

        max_color2 = max(color2)

        result = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            result[i] = color1[node_color1[i]] + max_color2

        return result
```

## Notes

- The trees are assumed to be **bipartite**, allowing valid 2-color BFS.
- For each node in the first tree:
  - Count of same-color nodes in its tree is added to the largest color group from the second tree.
- Efficient BFS guarantees O(n + m) time complexity for tree traversal.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- Time: O(n + m), where n and m are number of nodes in tree1 and tree2 respectively.
- Space: O(n + m) for adjacency lists and visited arrays.

This method leverages bipartite properties to simulate combinatorial pairing across trees.
