# Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two-Letter Words

## Problem Description

You are given a list of two-letter lowercase words. Your task is to form the **longest palindrome** possible by concatenating words from the list. Each word can be used at most once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Rules:
- You can reverse a word to match with its reverse (e.g., "ab" and "ba").
- Palindromic words like "aa", "bb", etc., can be placed in the center or used in pairs on both sides of the palindrome.
- Return the **maximum length** of the palindrome that can be formed.

### Example:

```
Input: words = ["lc","cl","gg"]
Output: 6

Explanation:
- Use "lc" + "gg" + "cl" → forms "lcggcl", which is a palindrome of length 6.
```

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, words):
        freq = Counter(words)
        ans = 0
        has_center = False

        for word in list(freq.keys()):
            rev = word[::-1]
            if word == rev:
                pairs = freq[word] // 2
                ans += pairs * 4
                freq[word] -= pairs * 2
                if freq[word] == 1:
                    has_center = True
            else:
                if rev in freq:
                    pairs = min(freq[word], freq[rev])
                    ans += pairs * 4
                    freq[word] -= pairs
                    freq[rev] -= pairs

        if has_center:
            ans += 2

        return ans
```

## Notes

- **Palindromic pairs** like "aa", "bb" contribute 4 characters per pair (2 words × 2 characters).
- **Non-palindromic reverses** like "ab" and "ba" also form palindromic blocks.
- If a palindromic word is left over after pairing (e.g., one "aa" left), it can be placed in the **center** to contribute 2 more characters.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of words.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for frequency map.

Greedy pairing with frequency counting ensures optimal use of words to maximize the palindrome length.
