# 🏷 Count Numbers Not Divisible by 3

# 📜 Problem Statement
Given a list of integers `nums`, determine how many elements require at least one operation to become divisible by 3. An element requires an operation if `num % 3 > 0`. The method returns the count of such elements.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output
Input:
```

nums = [1, 3, 4, 9, 10]

```
Output:
```

3

````
Explanation: `1, 4, 10` are not divisible by 3 → require operations.

# 🧠 Approach
1. Iterate through each number in `nums`.
2. For each number, check whether `num % 3 > 0` (i.e., not divisible by 3).
3. Convert the Boolean result into integers (`True` → `1`, `False` → `0`) and sum them.
4. Return the total count.

# 💻 Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(num % 3 > 0 for num in nums)
````

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1), uses only constant extra memory.

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* Empty list `[]` → returns `0`.
* All numbers divisible by 3 → returns `0`.
* All numbers not divisible by 3 → returns `len(nums)`.
* Negative numbers: modulo still works; negative values divisible by 3 are counted correctly.
* Large integers: modulo operation handles them without issue.
