# Maximum Frequency Elements

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Given an integer array `nums` where each element is between `1` and `100`, find the **sum of frequencies of elements that appear most frequently**. In other words:
- First, find the maximum frequency of any number.
- Then, return the sum of frequencies of all numbers that appear with this maximum frequency.

🔍 **Example Input/Output**  
**Input**  
    nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]

**Output**  
    4

**Explanation**  
- Frequencies: 1 → 2, 2 → 2, 3 → 1, 4 → 1.  
- Maximum frequency = 2.  
- Elements with this frequency are 1 and 2.  
- Sum of frequencies = 2 + 2 = 4.

**Input**  
    nums = [5,5,5,6]

**Output**  
    3

**Explanation**  
- Frequencies: 5 → 3, 6 → 1.  
- Maximum frequency = 3 (element 5).  
- Only element 5 has this frequency.  
- Sum = 3.

🧠 **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Initialize a frequency array `freq` of size 101 (since `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`) to count occurrences.  
2. Keep track of:
   - `mx`: current maximum frequency observed.
   - `res`: sum of frequencies of elements that match the maximum frequency.  
3. For each number `n` in `nums`:
   - Increment `freq[n]`.  
   - If this frequency is greater than `mx`, update `mx` and set `res = freq[n]`.  
   - If this frequency equals `mx`, add `freq[n]` to `res`.  
4. Return `res` after processing all numbers.

💻 **Code**  

    class Solution:
        def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
            freq = [0] * 101
            mx = 0
            res = 0
            for n in nums:
                freq[n] += 1
                f = freq[n]
                if f > mx:
                    mx = f
                    res = f
                elif f == mx:
                    res += f
            return res

⏱ **Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n = len(nums)`, since we process each number once.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because frequency array size is fixed (101).

🧪 **Edge Cases**  
- Single element array (e.g., `[7]`) → maximum frequency = 1, sum = 1.  
- All elements distinct (e.g., `[1,2,3,4]`) → maximum frequency = 1, sum = number of elements.  
- All elements same (e.g., `[2,2,2,2]`) → maximum frequency = len(nums), sum = len(nums).  
- Minimum/maximum values of `nums` (1 or 100) → handled correctly by fixed-size array.
