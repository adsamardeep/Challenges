# Maximum Adjacent Distance

## Problem Description

Given a list of integers `nums`, your task is to find the **maximum absolute difference** between any two adjacent elements in the list. Additionally, you must also consider the absolute difference between the **first** and **last** elements as a potential candidate.

### Example

Input: `nums = [1, 3, 7, 2, 5]`  
Output: `6`

### Explanation

- Adjacent differences:
  - `|1 - 3| = 2`
  - `|3 - 7| = 4`
  - `|7 - 2| = 5`
  - `|2 - 5| = 3`
- Endpoints difference:
  - `|1 - 5| = 4`
- Max of all differences: `max(2, 4, 5, 3, 4) = 6`

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAdjacentDistance(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        maxa = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])
        for i in range(n - 1):
            maxa = max(maxa, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))
        return maxa
```

## How It Works

- Initialize `maxa` as the absolute difference between the first and last elements.
- Iterate through the list and compute absolute differences for all adjacent pairs.
- Keep track of the maximum value seen.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), using constant space.

This is an efficient one-pass solution that ensures the largest absolute gap between any two consecutive elements (including circular endpoint comparison) is found.
