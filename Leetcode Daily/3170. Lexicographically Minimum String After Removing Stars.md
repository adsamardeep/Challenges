# Clear Stars from String

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters and asterisks (`*`). Every time an asterisk appears, it removes the **smallest lexicographical character** that appeared before it (i.e., closest and smallest alphabetically). Both the asterisk and the removed character are deleted from the final result.

Your task is to return the string after all such operations have been applied.

### Example

Input: `s = "ab*c*d"`  
Output: `"d"`

### Explanation

- `'a'` and `'b'` are pushed → `"ab"`
- `'*'` removes `'a'` (smallest so far) → result becomes `"b"`
- `'c'` pushed → `"bc"`
- `'*'` removes `'b'` → `"c"`
- `'d'` added → `"cd"`

Final string: `"d"`

## Python Solution

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution(object):
    def clearStars(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        pq = []  # Min-heap to store characters
        m = defaultdict(deque)  # Map character -> deque of indices
        keep = [True] * n  # Marks whether to keep character at index

        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '*':
                smallest = heapq.heappop(pq)  # Get smallest character
                idx = m[smallest].pop()      # Remove last occurrence index
                keep[i] = False              # Mark '*' for removal
                keep[idx] = False            # Mark smallest char for removal
            else:
                heapq.heappush(pq, s[i])
                m[s[i]].append(i)

        # Build result from characters not marked for removal
        return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(n) if keep[i])
```

## How It Works

- **Min-Heap (`pq`)** keeps track of the smallest characters seen so far.
- **`m` map** stores the positions (indices) of each character so we can find and remove the last one efficiently.
- When a `'*'` is encountered:
  - The smallest character is popped from the heap.
  - Its most recent index is looked up and marked for removal.
  - The `'*'` itself is also marked for removal.
- The result is built by including only characters that were **not removed**.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of letters currently in the heap.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for tracking character positions and removal flags.

This algorithm efficiently ensures that the correct characters are removed according to the rules of minimal lexicographic deletion.
