# 🏷 Maximum Operations on Binary String (counting 1→0 transitions)

# 📜 Problem Statement
Given a binary string `s`, you can perform an operation every time a `'0'` immediately follows one or more `'1'`s.  
Each such `'0'` contributes an amount equal to the total number of `'1'`s seen so far.  
Return the total number of such operations across the string.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output
Input:
```

s = "11010"

```
Output:
```

5

````
Explanation:  
- At index 2 (`s[2] = 0`), preceded by `1`, accumulated ones = 2 → add 2.  
- At index 4 (`s[4] = 0`), preceded by `1`, accumulated ones = 3 → add 3.  
Total = 2 + 3 = 5.

# 🧠 Approach
1. Maintain a counter `ones` for how many `'1'`s have been seen so far.  
2. Traverse the string character by character:
   - If the character is `'1'`, increment `ones`.
   - If the character is `'0'` **and** the previous character is `'1'`, it marks a valid 1→0 boundary — add `ones` to the result.
3. Return the accumulated `res` after the full traversal.

# 💻 Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        ones = 0
        res = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c == '1':
                ones += 1
            elif i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '1':
                res += ones
        return res

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — single pass over the string.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — constant extra memory.

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* `s = ""`: returns `0` (empty string).
* `s = "0"` or all zeros: returns `0` (no `'1'` to trigger operations).
* `s = "1"`: returns `0` (no `'0'` to complete a transition).
* `s = "1010"`: correctly counts two transitions.
* `s` ending in `'1'`: handled naturally; only `'0'` after `'1'` matters.
