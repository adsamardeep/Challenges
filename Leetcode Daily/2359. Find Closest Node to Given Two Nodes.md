# Closest Meeting Node in a Graph

## Problem Description

You are given a directed graph represented as a list `edges` where each `edges[i]` points to the next node that can be reached from node `i`. If `edges[i] == -1`, node `i` has no outgoing edge.

Given two nodes `node1` and `node2`, the goal is to find the node that is the **closest meeting point** where both `node1` and `node2` can meet.

**Key Definition**:
- The distance from a node to another node is the number of edges in the shortest path between them.
- The closest meeting node is the node where both `node1` and `node2` have the **smallest maximum distance**.

### Example:

```
Input:
edges = [2,2,-1,2]
node1 = 0
node2 = 1

Output:
2

Explanation:
- Starting from node1 (0), the distance to node 2 is 2.
- Starting from node2 (1), the distance to node 2 is also 1.
- Node 2 is the closest meeting node as both can meet there with the smallest maximum distance.
```

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, edges, start):
        dist = [-1] * len(edges)
        d = 0
        while start != -1 and dist[start] == -1:
            dist[start] = d
            d += 1
            start = edges[start]
        return dist

    def closestMeetingNode(self, edges, node1, node2):
        dist1 = self.dfs(edges, node1)
        dist2 = self.dfs(edges, node2)
        result = -1
        min_dist = float('inf')

        for i in range(len(edges)):
            if dist1[i] != -1 and dist2[i] != -1:
                max_dist = max(dist1[i], dist2[i])
                if max_dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = max_dist
                    result = i

        return result
```

## Notes

- The DFS is used to compute the **distance** from each node to `-1` (or the end of the graph).
- The solution computes the **maximum distance** from both `node1` and `node2` for each node.
- The **closest meeting node** is the node that minimizes this maximum distance.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. The DFS runs twice, once from `node1` and once from `node2`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing distances for all nodes.

This solution works efficiently by calculating the shortest distance from each node and comparing them.
