# Max Difference Between Odd and Even Frequencies

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, compute the **maximum difference** between the **highest odd frequency** and the **lowest even frequency** of characters in the string.

If no odd or even frequencies exist, the function should return the result of `max_odd - min_even`, where:
- `max_odd` is initialized as negative infinity (`-inf`)
- `min_even` is initialized as positive infinity (`inf`)

### Example

Input: `"aabbccc"`  
Output: `3 - 2 = 1`

### Explanation

- Frequencies: `a:2`, `b:2`, `c:3`
- Even frequencies: `2, 2` → min = `2`
- Odd frequency: `3` → max = `3`
- Difference: `3 - 2 = 1`

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution(object):
    def maxDifference(self, s):
        freq = Counter(s)
        min_even = float('inf')
        max_odd = float('-inf')

        for count in freq.values():
            if count % 2 == 0:
                min_even = min(min_even, count)
            else:
                max_odd = max(max_odd, count)

        return max_odd - min_even
```

## How It Works

- Count the frequency of each character using `Counter`.
- Track the **minimum even** and **maximum odd** frequencies separately.
- Return the difference between `max_odd` and `min_even`.

## Edge Cases

- If the string has only even frequencies → `max_odd` remains `-inf`
- If the string has only odd frequencies → `min_even` remains `inf`
- Result will be mathematically correct but may be `inf` or `-inf` in degenerate cases unless handled separately.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the character set is fixed (26 lowercase letters).

You may choose to add error handling for cases where no even or no odd frequencies exist, depending on the problem's constraints.
