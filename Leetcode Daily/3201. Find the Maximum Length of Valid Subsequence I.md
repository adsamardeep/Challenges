# 🔍 Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I

This repository contains a Python implementation of a solution to LeetCode Problem **3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I**.

---

## 📘 Problem Overview

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subsequence `sub` of `nums` is called **valid** if for every consecutive pair in the subsequence:

```
(sub[i] + sub[i+1]) % 2
```

remains the same for all `i`. In essence, either all adjacent sums are even or all are odd.

Return the length of the **longest valid subsequence** of `nums`.

---

## 🚀 Approach

Observe that since sums need to maintain the same parity, every element in the subsequence at **odd positions** must have the same parity, and all at **even positions** must also match each other (though possibly different from the odd positions).

A compact dynamic programming approach tracks `(dp[0][0], dp[0][1], dp[1][0], dp[1][1])`, where:

- `dp[x][y]` = maximum valid subsequence length ending with an element of parity `x`, expecting the next to be parity `y`.

For each `num` in `nums`:
1. Compute `r = num % 2`.
2. For `y ∈ {0,1}`, update:
   ```
   dp[r][y] = dp[y][r] + 1
   ```
3. The answer is the maximum value in the DP table.

## 💻 Code Example

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(2)]
        ans = 0
        for x in nums:
            r = x & 1
            for y in (0, 1):
                dp[r][y] = dp[y][r] + 1
                ans = max(ans, dp[r][y])
        return ans

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maximumLength([1, 2, 3, 4]))          # Output: 4
print(sol.maximumLength([1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2])) # Output: 6
print(sol.maximumLength([1, 3]))               # Output: 2
```

## ✅ Explanation

- We maintain a 2×2 DP matrix:
  - `dp[a][b]` tracks the longest valid subsequence where the last element has parity `a`, and we expect the next one to have parity `b`.
- For each new number with parity `r`, appending it to a subsequence ending in parity `y` flips the next expectation from `y` → `r`, extending the subsequence.
- This solution runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space.
