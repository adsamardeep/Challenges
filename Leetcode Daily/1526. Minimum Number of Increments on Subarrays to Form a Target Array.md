# Minimum Number of Operations to Form Target Array 

📜 **Problem Statement**  
You start with an array of all zeros and can perform the following operation:  
- Choose any contiguous subarray and increment **each element** in that subarray by 1.

Given an integer array `target`, return the **minimum number of operations** required to form `target` from an array of zeros.

🔍 **Example Input / Output**  
**Input**  
    target = [1,2,3,2,1]  

**Output**  
    3  

**Explanation**  
Operations sequence example:
1. Increment entire range [0..4] → [1,1,1,1,1]  
2. Increment subarray [1..3] → [1,2,2,2,1]  
3. Increment subarray [2..2] → [1,2,3,2,1]  

Total = **3 operations**

🧠 **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Let `prev` track the previous value (start with 0).  
2. For each element `x` in `target`:
   - If `x` > `prev`, it means we need `(x - prev)` new operations to raise this element and possibly future ones to this higher level.  
   - If `x` ≤ `prev`, no new operations are needed (previous operations already achieved this height or more).  
3. Sum all these required increments — that’s the minimum number of operations.

💻 **Code**  

    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def minNumberOperations(self, target: List[int]) -> int:
            res = prev = 0
            for x in target:
                if x > prev:
                    res += x - prev
                prev = x
            return res

⏱ **Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time:** O(n), single pass over the array.  
- **Space:** O(1), uses only two variables (`res`, `prev`).

🧪 **Edge Cases**  
| Input | Output | Explanation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [1,2,3,2,1] | 3 | Increasing then decreasing pattern |
| [3,1,1,2] | 4 | New increments at positions 0 (3), and 3 (+1 more) |
| [3,3,3] | 3 | One contiguous range incremented 3 times |
| [1,1,1] | 1 | Only one operation needed |
| [0,0,0] | 0 | No operations needed |

✅ **Key Insight**  
The answer is simply the sum of all **positive differences** between consecutive elements, including the first element:  
\[
\text{minOperations} = target[0] + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \max(0, target[i] - target[i-1])
\]
This captures exactly the new "height" increases required to build `target`.
