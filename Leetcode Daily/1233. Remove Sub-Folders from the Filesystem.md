# 📁 Remove Subfolders from Filesystem

This repository contains a Python solution to the problem of removing all subfolders from a list of folder paths.

---

## 📘 Problem Overview

Given a list of folder paths, return a list that **removes all subfolders**, keeping only the **top-level folders**.

### A folder `b` is a subfolder of a folder `a` if:
- `b` starts with `a + '/'`

---

## 💡 Example

```python
Input: folder = ["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]
Output: ["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]
```

Explanation:
- "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" → removed
- "/c/d/e" is a subfolder of "/c/d" → removed

---

## 🚀 Approach

1. Convert the folder list into a set for **O(1)** prefix checks.
2. Iterate through each folder:
   - For every `'/'` position in the path, check if the prefix up to that slash is in the set.
   - If so, it means this folder is a subfolder and should be excluded.
3. If no parent is found, include the folder in the result.

This avoids sorting or building a trie.

## 💻 Code Example

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeSubfolders(self, folder: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        dirSet = set(folder)
        res = []

        for dir in folder:
            res.append(dir)
            for i in range(len(dir)):
                if dir[i] == '/' and dir[:i] in dirSet:
                    res.pop()  # Remove if parent found
                    break

        return res

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.removeSubfolders(["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]))
# Output: ['/a', '/c/d', '/c/f']
```

## ✅ Notes

- No sorting is required.
- The logic relies on checking path prefixes using a set.
- Time complexity is O(N * L), where N is number of folders and L is average folder length.
