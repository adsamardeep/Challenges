# Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs

## Problem Description

Given a list of dominoes represented as pairs of integers, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` for which:
- `i < j`, and
- Dominoes `i` and `j` are **equivalent**.

Two dominoes `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` are considered equivalent if:
```
a == c and b == d, or a == d and b == c
```

That is, the order doesn't matter â€” `[1, 2]` is equivalent to `[2, 1]`.

### Example

**Input:**  
`dominoes = [[1,2], [2,1], [3,4], [5,6]]`

**Output:**  
`1`

**Explanation:**  
Only `[1,2]` and `[2,1]` are equivalent.

## Approach

1. Normalize each domino so that the smaller number comes first (i.e., `[1,2]` and `[2,1]` both become `(1,2)`).
2. Use a hash map (`defaultdict`) to count the frequency of each normalized domino.
3. For each group of identical dominoes with frequency `f`, the number of equivalent pairs is:
```
f * (f - 1) // 2
```

Sum up the pair counts across all groups.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numEquivDominoPairs(self, dominoes):
        from collections import defaultdict
        count_map = defaultdict(int)
        count = 0
        for a, b in dominoes:
            key = tuple(sorted((a, b)))
            count_map[key] += 1
        for freq in count_map.values():
            count += freq * (freq - 1) // 2
        return count
```
