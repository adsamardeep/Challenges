# Total Money After `days` (LeetCode: "Total Money")

üìú **Problem Statement**  
You deposit money into a bank over `days` days following a weekly pattern:  
- In week `i` (0-based), on Monday you deposit `1 + i`, on Tuesday `2 + i`, ‚Ä¶, on Sunday `7 + i`.  
Compute the total amount of money deposited after `days` days.

üîç **Example Input / Output**  
Input: `days = 10`  
Output: `37`  
Explanation:  
Week 0 ‚Üí 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28  
Week 1 ‚Üí 2+3+4 = 9  
Total = 37

üß† **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Each week‚Äôs deposits start from `(week_index + 1)` and increase by 1 each day.  
2. The sum of one week‚Äôs deposits = `28 + 7 * week_index`.  
3. Total after `w` full weeks = `28*w + 7*(w*(w-1)//2)`.  
4. For remaining `r` days, deposits start from `(w + 1)` ‚Üí sum = `r*w + (r*(r+1)//2)`.  
5. Add both to get total money.  

üíª **Code**  

    class Solution:
        def triSum(self, n: int) -> int:
            # Triangular sum helper: sum of 1..n
            if n <= 0:
                return 0
            return (n * (n + 1)) // 2

        def totalMoney(self, days: int) -> int:
            nWeeks, rDays = divmod(days, 7)
            # Formula using full weeks and remainder days
            fullWeeks = 28 * nWeeks + 7 * nWeeks * (nWeeks - 1) // 2
            remainder = rDays * nWeeks + rDays * (rDays + 1) // 2
            return fullWeeks + remainder

‚è± **Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time:** O(1) (only arithmetic operations)  
- **Space:** O(1)  

üß™ **Edge Cases**  
- `days = 0` ‚Üí returns `0`  
- `days < 7` ‚Üí handled correctly by `divmod`  
- `days` large ‚Üí works for any integer size (Python handles big integers)  

‚úÖ **Example Checks**  
| days | Output | Explanation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 4 | 10 | 1+2+3+4 |
| 10 | 37 | Week0=28 + Week1(2+3+4)=9 |
| 20 | 96 | Weeks(0‚Äì2)+Partial week contributions |
