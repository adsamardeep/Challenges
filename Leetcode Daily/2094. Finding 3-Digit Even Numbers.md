# Find All 3-Digit Even Numbers

## Problem Description

Given a list of digits, the task is to find all unique 3-digit even numbers that can be formed using the digits from the list. Each digit from the input can be used at most as many times as it appears in the list. The result should only include valid 3-digit even numbers (i.e., numbers from 100 to 998 that end in an even digit) and should not contain duplicates.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findEvenNumbers(self, digits):
        from collections import Counter
        freq = Counter(digits)
        res = []
        for num in range(100, 1000, 2):
            parts = [num // 100, (num // 10) % 10, num % 10]
            count = Counter(parts)
            if all(freq[d] >= count[d] for d in count):
                res.append(num)
        return res
