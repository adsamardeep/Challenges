# Remove Consecutive Anagrams

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Given a list of strings `words`, remove all **consecutive anagrams** — words that are next to each other and contain exactly the same characters (regardless of order).  
Return the resulting list after repeatedly removing consecutive anagrams until none remain.

Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters with the same frequencies, i.e., their character counts are identical.

🔍 **Example Input / Output**  
**Input**
    words = ["abba","baba","bbaa","cd","cd"]

**Output**
    ["abba","cd"]

**Explanation**
- "abba", "baba", and "bbaa" are anagrams of each other, but only the first occurrence ("abba") is kept.  
- "cd" and "cd" are also consecutive anagrams, so keep one of them.  
Final result → `["abba", "cd"]`.

🧠 **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Compute a **character frequency map** for each word using `collections.Counter`.  
2. Initialize the result list `ans` with the first word (since there’s nothing before it).  
3. Iterate through each subsequent word:
   - If the frequency map of the current word `freq[i]` is **different** from the previous one `freq[i-1]`, append the current word to the result.
   - If they’re equal (i.e., consecutive anagrams), skip adding it.  
4. Return the list `ans`.

💻 **Code**  

    from collections import Counter

    class Solution(object):
        def removeAnagrams(self, words):
            n = len(words)
            if n == 0:
                return []
            freq = [Counter(w) for w in words]
            ans = [words[0]]
            for i in range(1, n):
                if freq[i] != freq[i - 1]:
                    ans.append(words[i])
            return ans

⏱ **Complexity Analysis**  
- Let `n = len(words)` and `L = max(len(word))`.  
- Building each Counter: O(L) per word → O(n * L) total.  
- Comparing consecutive Counters: O(26) (constant) since only lowercase letters are involved.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * L)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * 26) = O(n) for storing Counters.

🧪 **Edge Cases**  
- Empty list → returns `[]`.  
- Single word → returns `[word]` (no anagram to remove).  
- All words are identical → returns only the first one.  
- All words distinct (non-anagrams) → returns the same list.  
- Case sensitivity → `Counter` treats uppercase/lowercase as different characters (so "Ab" ≠ "ba").  
- If inputs can include Unicode characters, the same logic applies since `Counter` handles all hashable characters.
