# Count Balanced Permutations

## Problem Description

You are given a string `num` consisting of digits (`0`â€“`9`). Your task is to count the number of ways to rearrange the digits of `num` such that the resulting permutation is **balanced**.

A permutation is **balanced** if it can be split into two halves with:
- The same length (i.e., `len(num)` is even), and
- The same digit sum in each half.

Return the total number of such balanced permutations **modulo `10^9 + 7`**.

### Example

**Input:**  
`num = "123321"`  
**Output:**  
`90`

**Explanation:**  
There are 90 different permutations of "123321" such that both halves of the string have equal digit sums.

## Constraints

- The length of `num` is at most 50.
- The digits are in the range '0' to '9'.
- The length of `num` is always even.

## Approach

This is a combinatorics + dynamic programming problem involving:
- **Preprocessing:** Count digit frequencies.
- **Recursion with Memoization:** Use depth-first search (DFS) to try allocating different digit distributions to the first half such that the total sum matches `total_sum / 2`.
- **Combinatorics:** 
  - Use the `math.comb` function for computing combinations.
  - Precompute multinomial coefficients efficiently using cumulative digit counts from right to left.
- **Memoization:** Use `@lru_cache` to cache results for subproblems defined by index, remaining sum, and count.

The recursive function `dfs(i, s, c)` computes:
- The number of ways to pick `c` digits summing to `s`, starting from digit `i` onward.
- Ensures that digits chosen for the first half leave valid counterparts for the second half.

## Python Solution

```python
from functools import lru_cache
from math import comb

class Solution:
    def countBalancedPermutations(self, num: str) -> int:
        M = 10**9 + 7
        cnt = [0] * 10
        for ch in num:
            cnt[int(ch)] += 1

        n = len(num)
        s = sum(int(ch) for ch in num)
        if s % 2:
            return 0

        left_s = [0] * 10
        left_c = [0] * 10
        r1 = [1] * 11
        ls = lc = 0
        for i in range(9, -1, -1):
            ls += i * cnt[i]
            lc += cnt[i]
            left_s[i] = ls
            left_c[i] = lc
            r1[i] = r1[i + 1] * comb(left_c[i], cnt[i]) % M

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, s, c):
            if s == 0 and c == 0:
                return r1[i]
            if i == 10 or s > left_s[i] or c > left_c[i]:
                return 0
            res = 0
            a = s
            for x in range(cnt[i] + 1):
                y = cnt[i] - x
                if a < 0 or c < x or y > left_c[i] - c:
                    a -= i
                    continue
                b = dfs(i + 1, a, c - x) * comb(c, x) % M
                res = (res + b * comb(left_c[i] - c, y)) % M
                a -= i
            return res

        return dfs(0, s // 2, n // 2)
```
