# 🟩 Problem: Longest Subarray of 1’s After Deleting One Element

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a binary array `nums`.  
You must **delete exactly one element** from the array, then return the length of the **longest subarray containing only 1’s**.

---

## 🔍 Example 1
**Input**
    nums = [1,1,0,1]

**Output**
    3

**Explanation**
    Delete the `0`, resulting array = `[1,1,1]`, which has length `3`.

---

## 🔍 Example 2
**Input**
    nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]

**Output**
    5

**Explanation**
    Delete the first `0`; the longest subarray of 1’s is `[1,1,1,1,1]` (length 5).

---

## 🔍 Example 3
**Input**
    nums = [1,1,1]

**Output**
    2

**Explanation**
    We must delete one element, so the best we can do is `[1,1]`.

## 🧠 Approach
We use a **sliding window** with two pointers to keep at most **one zero** inside the window:
1. Expand the right pointer; when we see a zero, increase a counter.
2. If we have more than one zero, move the left pointer forward until the window contains at most one zero.
3. At each step, the candidate answer is `right - left` (because we must delete one element, effectively removing one zero in the window).

## 💻 Code Implementation
    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            left, zeros, res = 0, 0, 0
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] == 0:
                    zeros += 1
                while zeros > 1:
                    if nums[left] == 0:
                        zeros -= 1
                    left += 1
                # delete one element (the zero in the window if present)
                res = max(res, right - left)
            return res

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — each index moves into and out of the window at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a few pointers/counters.

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- All 1’s → must delete one element ⇒ result = `len(nums) - 1`.
- Single element → result = `0` (because we must delete it).
- Many zeros → window logic ensures we never keep more than one zero.
