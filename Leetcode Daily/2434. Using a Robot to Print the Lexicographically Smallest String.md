# Robot With String

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s`, and a robot with a stack that can perform the following operations:

1. **Push** the next character from `s` onto the stack.
2. **Pop** the top character from the stack and append it to the result string.

The goal is to produce the **lexicographically smallest possible string** by choosing when to perform these operations optimally.

At each step, you can choose whether to pop from the stack (if it is not empty) or push the next character from the input string. The trick is to ensure the characters are output in the smallest lexicographic order.

### Example

Input: `s = "bac"`  
Output: `"abc"`

### Explanation

- Push `'b'` onto stack → stack = `['b']`
- Push `'a'` → stack = `['b', 'a']`
- Pop `'a'` (smallest lexically available) → result = `'a'`
- Pop `'b'` → result = `'ab'`
- Push `'c'`, then pop `'c'` → result = `'abc'`

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def robotWithString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        from collections import Counter

        freq = Counter(s)
        st = []
        res = []
        
        def min_char(freq):
            for i in range(26):
                ch = chr(ord('a') + i)
                if freq[ch] > 0:
                    return ch
            return 'a'

        for ch in s:
            st.append(ch)
            freq[ch] -= 1
            while st and st[-1] <= min_char(freq):
                res.append(st.pop())

        while st:
            res.append(st.pop())

        return ''.join(res)
```

## How It Works

- A frequency counter keeps track of how many characters remain in the input string.
- At each step, we check whether the top of the stack is less than or equal to the smallest remaining character in the input.
- If it is, we pop from the stack and add to the result.
- This ensures that we always output the smallest valid character at each moment.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the stack and result list.

This greedy algorithm ensures the final string is the lexicographically smallest possible.
