# 🏷 Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine the minimum total ASCII value of characters that must be deleted from both strings so that they become equal. Deletions can be made from either string, and the goal is to minimize the sum of ASCII values of deleted characters.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
s1 = "sea"
s2 = "eat"
````

**Output:**

```python
231
```

**Explanation:**
Delete `'s'` (ASCII 115) from `"sea"` and `'t'` (ASCII 116) from `"eat"`.
Total = `115 + 116 = 231`.

## 🧠 Approach

1. Ensure the second string is not longer than the first to optimize space.
2. Use **dynamic programming** where `dp[j]` represents the minimum delete sum to make:

   * `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]` equal.
3. Initialize the first row by deleting all characters from `s2`.
4. Iterate through characters of `s1`:

   * Update `dp[0]` by deleting characters from `s1`.
   * For each character pair:

     * If characters match, carry over the diagonal value.
     * Otherwise, choose the minimum cost between deleting from `s1` or `s2`.
5. Use a rolling 1D DP array to save space.

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDeleteSum(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
        if len(s2) > len(s1):
            s1, s2 = s2, s1

        n, m = len(s1), len(s2)

        dp = [0] * (m + 1)

        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + ord(s2[j - 1])

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prev_diag = dp[0]
            dp[0] += ord(s1[i - 1])

            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                temp = dp[j]
                if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                    dp[j] = prev_diag
                else:
                    dp[j] = min(
                        dp[j - 1] + ord(s2[j - 1]),
                        temp + ord(s1[i - 1])
                    )
                prev_diag = temp

        return dp[m]
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n × m)`
  Each pair of characters is processed once.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(m)`
  Optimized to a single DP array.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* One or both strings are empty
* Strings are already equal
* All characters must be deleted from one string
* Large strings with no common characters
