# 🟩 Problem: Split Number Into Two No-Zero Integers

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, split it into two positive integers `a` and `b` such that:

- `a + b = n`
- Neither `a` nor `b` contains the digit `'0'`.

Return `[a, b]`.  
It is guaranteed that at least one valid solution exists.

## 🔍 Example

Input:  
    n = 11  

Output:  
    [2, 9]  

Explanation:  
- 2 + 9 = 11  
- Neither 2 nor 9 contains digit `'0'`.  

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. Define a helper function `check(x)` that returns `True` if integer `x` has no `'0'` digit.  
2. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`:  
   - Let `j = n - i`.  
   - If both `i` and `j` pass the `check` test, return `[i, j]`.  
3. Since the problem guarantees a solution, the loop always finds a valid pair.

## 💻 Code 

    class Solution:
        def getNoZeroIntegers(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
            def check(x):
                return '0' not in str(x)

            for i in range(1, n):
                j = n - i
                if check(i) and check(j):
                    return [i, j]

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n × d)  
  - Where `d` is the number of digits (to check `'0'` in string).  
  - Efficient enough for reasonable constraints.  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- Smallest n = 2 → valid answer is `[1, 1]`.  
- n = 101 → `[2, 99]` works.  
- n with many zeros (e.g., 10000) → algorithm still finds valid pair since at least one solution is guaranteed.
