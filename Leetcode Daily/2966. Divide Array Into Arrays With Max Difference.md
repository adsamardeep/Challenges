# Divide Array Into Triplets With Maximum Difference

## 🧩 Problem Description

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to:

- Divide the array into groups of **exactly 3 elements**.
- Ensure that for **each group**, the **maximum difference** between the largest and smallest element is **at most `k`**.

Return a list of all such valid groups. If it's not possible to divide the array this way, return an empty list.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], k = 4  
Output: [[1, 3, 5], [7, 9, 11]]  
Explanation: Each group has 3 elements and max difference ≤ 4.
```

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def divideArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        res = []

        for i in range(0, len(nums), 3):
            # Check for a valid triplet
            if i + 2 >= len(nums) or nums[i + 2] - nums[i] > k:
                return []
            res.append([nums[i], nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2]])

        return res
```

## ✅ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \( O(n \log n) \) due to sorting the array.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \( O(n) \) for storing the result list of triplets.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Sorting ensures that the smallest and largest values in every consecutive triplet are at known positions, making validation straightforward.
- The loop increments by 3 to ensure that the array is divided into disjoint triplets.
- If the last group cannot be formed or the triplet condition is violated, the function returns an empty list immediately.
