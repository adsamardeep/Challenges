# Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful — Single Markdown Block

📜 **Problem Statement**  
Given a string `colors` and an integer list `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time to remove the `i`-th balloon, remove balloons so that no two adjacent balloons have the same color. Return the minimum total time required.

🔍 **Example**  
Input:  
    colors = "abaac"  
    neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]  

Output:  
    3

(Explanation: remove the `'a'` at index 2 with time 3.)

🧠 **Approach (step-by-step)**  
1. Iterate once through the string, grouping consecutive equal colors.  
2. For each group of equal colors, to avoid adjacent equal colors you must remove all but the one with the maximum removal time.  
3. As you scan, keep `curr_max_time` for the ongoing group and add `min(curr_max_time, neededTime[i])` to the answer when you encounter a same-color balloon — this effectively removes the cheaper of the two (keeping the larger).  
4. When color changes, reset the group state.

    class Solution:
        def minCost(self, colors: str, neededTime: list[int]) -> int:
            total_time, curr_max_time = 0, 0

            for i in range(len(colors)):
                # New color group: reset the running max
                if i > 0 and colors[i] != colors[i - 1]:
                    curr_max_time = 0

                # Remove the cheaper balloon between current and the best so far in the group
                total_time += min(curr_max_time, neededTime[i])

                # Update the max time in this group
                curr_max_time = max(curr_max_time, neededTime[i])

            return total_time

⏱ **Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time:** O(n) — single pass over `colors`.  
- **Space:** O(1) — constant extra space.

🧪 **Edge Cases**  
- All distinct colors → result `0`.  
- All identical colors → remove all but the one with largest `neededTime`.  
- Empty input → result `0`.
