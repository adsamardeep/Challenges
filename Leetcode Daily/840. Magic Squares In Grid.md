# 🏷 Count 3×3 Magic Squares in a Grid

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of integers, determine how many **3×3 subgrids** form a valid magic square. A magic square must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once, and all rows, columns, and diagonals must sum to the same value (15).

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
grid = [
  [4, 3, 8, 4],
  [9, 5, 1, 9],
  [2, 7, 6, 2]
]
````

**Output:**

```python
1
```

## 🧠 Approach

1. Iterate over every possible 3×3 subgrid in the matrix.
2. For each subgrid:

   * Flatten its values into a list.
   * Check whether it contains exactly the numbers `1` through `9`.
   * Verify that:

     * All three rows sum to 15.
     * All three columns sum to 15.
     * Both diagonals sum to 15.
3. Count how many subgrids satisfy all the above conditions.

## 💻 Code 

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numMagicSquaresInside(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        x, y = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def isMagicSquares(r, c):
            s = [grid[r+i][c+j] for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]
            if sorted(s) != list(range(1, 10)):
                return False
            return (
                s[0] + s[1] + s[2] == s[3] + s[4] + s[5] == s[6] + s[7] + s[8] == 15 and
                s[0] + s[3] + s[6] == s[1] + s[4] + s[7] == s[2] + s[5] + s[8] == 15 and
                s[0] + s[4] + s[8] == s[2] + s[4] + s[6] == 15
            )

        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 2):
            for j in range(y - 2):
                if isMagicSquares(i, j):
                    count += 1
        return count
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`
  Each possible 3×3 subgrid is checked in constant time.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  Only a fixed-size list of 9 elements is used.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Grid smaller than 3×3 → result is `0`
* Duplicate or missing numbers in a subgrid
* Values outside the range `1–9`
* Multiple magic squares overlapping in the grid
