# 🔢 Count Largest Group

## 🧩 Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, define a group of integers in the range `[1, n]` based on the **sum of their digits**. For example:

- `13` has a digit sum of `1 + 3 = 4`
- `24` has a digit sum of `2 + 4 = 6`

Group all numbers from `1` to `n` based on their digit sum. Then, return the **number of groups** that have the **largest size**.

## 🐍 Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def countLargestGroup(self, n: int) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict

        digit_count = defaultdict(int)
        max_size = 0

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            s = sum(map(int, str(i)))
            digit_count[s] += 1
            max_size = max(max_size, digit_count[s])

        return sum(1 for count in digit_count.values() if count == max_size)
