# makeFancyString - Remove Triple Consecutive Characters

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return a new string where **no three identical characters appear consecutively**. You are allowed to keep **at most two** consecutive identical characters.

### âœ… Example
```python
Input:  "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
```

---

## ðŸ§  Approach

The algorithm works by iterating through each character in the string and:
- Keeping track of how many times the current character has repeated consecutively.
- Adding characters to the result only if they don't exceed two consecutive repetitions.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Points

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) â€” Iterates through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) â€” Stores the result string.

## ðŸ“„ Code

```python
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < 3:
            return s  # Too short to have 3 repeats

        result = s[0]  # Initialize with first character
        count = 1      # Initial repeat count

        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 1  # Reset count for new character

            if count < 3:
                result += s[i]  # Append only if allowed

        return result
```

## ðŸ“‚ Usage

You can use this function as part of a string-cleaning utility or text-processing pipeline to enforce rules on consecutive character repetitions.
