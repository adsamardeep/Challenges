# Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **number of non-empty subsequences** such that the **sum of the minimum and maximum elements** in the subsequence is **less than or equal to `target`**.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

## ✅ Solution

This solution leverages the **two-pointer technique** and **binary search** after sorting the input array.

### 🔹 Strategy:

1. **Sort `nums`** in non-decreasing order.
2. Use two pointers:
   - `l` from the start
   - `r` from the end
3. For each valid pair `nums[l] + nums[r] <= target`:
   - All subsets between `l` and `r` (inclusive) where `nums[l]` is the minimum and `nums[r]` is the maximum are valid.
   - There are `2^(r - l)` such subsets.
4. If the sum exceeds `target`, move `r` left using `bisect_right()` to find the largest valid `r`.

### 🧑‍💻 Code

```python
from typing import List
import bisect

class Solution:
    def numSubseq(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n, mod = len(nums), 10**9 + 7
        nums.sort()
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        ans = 0
        
        while l <= r:
            if nums[l] + nums[r] <= target:
                ans += (1 << (r - l))  # 2^(r - l) subsequences
                if ans >= mod:
                    ans %= mod
                l += 1
            else:
                r = bisect.bisect_right(nums, target - nums[l], lo=l, hi=r) - 1
        
        return ans
