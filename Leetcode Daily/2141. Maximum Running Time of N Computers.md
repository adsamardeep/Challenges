# 🏷 Maximum Equal Run Time for n Computers (Battery Allocation)

# 📜 Problem Statement  
Given `n` computers and a list of battery capacities `arr`, determine the maximum number of minutes all `n` computers can run **simultaneously**, assuming batteries can be reassigned but only used once.  
This solution balances batteries by removing the largest batteries that would exceed the average feasible runtime, then dividing the remaining total capacity evenly.

# 🔍 Example Input/Output  
Input:
```

n = 2
arr = [3, 3, 3]

```
Output:
```

4

````
Explanation: Total capacity is 9. The two computers can run for `9 // 2 = 4` minutes.

# 🧠 Approach  
1. Sort the batteries in ascending order.  
2. Compute total capacity.  
3. While the largest battery `arr[-1]` is larger than the average feasible runtime `total // n`, it cannot be part of the balanced distribution.  
   - Remove it, reduce `n`, and subtract its capacity from `total`.  
4. Once all batteries fit into the average constraint, the maximum uniform run time is `total // n`.

# 💻 Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxRunTime(self, n: int, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        arr.sort()
        total = sum(arr)

        while arr[-1] > total // n:
            n -= 1
            total -= arr.pop()

        return total // n

# ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(m log m), where m = len(arr), due to sorting.
* **Space:** O(1) extra space (sorting done in-place).

# 🧪 Edge Cases

* `n == len(arr)` or `n < len(arr)`.
* Very large battery dominating others (it gets removed in the loop).
* All batteries identical → direct division applies.
* `n = 1` → result is simply the total sum of all batteries.
* `arr` containing a single element.
