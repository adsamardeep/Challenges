# 🏷 Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given a sorted list of characters `letters` and a character `target`.  
Return the **smallest character in the list that is strictly greater than `target`**.  
If no such character exists, return the **first character in the list** (wrap-around behavior).

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input**
```python
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "d"
````

**Output**

```python
"f"
```

**Explanation**

* Letters greater than `"d"` are `"f"` and `"j"`
* Smallest among them is `"f"`

---

**Input**

```python
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "j"
```

**Output**

```python
"c"
```

**Explanation**

* No letter is greater than `"j"`
* Wrap around → return first letter `"c"`

## 🧠 Approach

This solution performs a **linear scan**:

1. Initialize the result as the first character (default wrap-around).
2. Track whether a valid greater character has been found.
3. When encountering a character greater than `target`:

   * If it's the first such character, store it.
   * Otherwise, keep the minimum among valid candidates.
4. Return the result.

Although correct, this approach does **not fully leverage the sorted property** of the input.

## 💻 Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        res = letters[0]
        flag = False

        for ch in letters:
            if not flag:
                if ch > target:
                    res = ch
                    flag = not flag
            else:
                if ch > target and ch < res:
                    res = ch

        return res
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — scans all letters
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — constant extra space

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* `target` greater than or equal to all letters → wrap-around case
* Multiple identical letters
* Single-character list
* `target` smaller than the first letter
