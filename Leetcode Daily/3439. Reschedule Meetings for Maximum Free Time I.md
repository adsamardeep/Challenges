# ‚è≥ Maximum Free Time Between Events

This repository contains a Python implementation that calculates the **maximum total free time** that can be obtained by removing up to `k` consecutive events from a schedule. The free time is defined as the total gaps (idle time) between events.

---

## üìò Problem Overview

You are given:
- `eventTime`: The total duration of the timeline.
- `startTime[]` and `endTime[]`: Arrays representing the start and end times of `n` scheduled events (in chronological order).
- `k`: The maximum number of consecutive events you are allowed to remove.

Your goal is to find the **maximum free time** that can be created by removing up to `k` **consecutive** events.

Free time is defined as:
- The time before the first event
- The gaps between consecutive events
- The time after the last event

## üöÄ Features

- Efficient **prefix sum** approach for range queries
- Handles edge cases: beginning and end of timeline
- Supports removing **consecutive** events only
- Linear time solution: `O(n)`

## üß† Algorithm

1. **Calculate all idle gaps** between events:
   - Before the first event
   - Between events
   - After the last event

2. Build a **prefix sum** array to efficiently compute the total gap in any subarray.

3. Slide a window of size `k + 1` over the prefix sum array and find the subarray with the **maximum total gap** ‚Äî this corresponds to removing `k` consecutive events.

4. Return the maximum free time observed.

## üíª Code Example

```python
class Solution:
    def maxFreeTime(self, eventTime, k, startTime, endTime):
        n = len(startTime)
        gaps = [0] * (n + 1)
        gaps[0] = startTime[0]
        gaps[n] = eventTime - endTime[-1]

        for i in range(1, n):
            gaps[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1]

        prefix = [0] * (n + 2)
        for i in range(1, n + 2):
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + gaps[i - 1]

        max_free = 0
        for i in range(k + 1, n + 2):
            max_free = max(max_free, prefix[i] - prefix[i - (k + 1)])

        return max_free

# Example usage
eventTime = 100
startTime = [10, 30, 50, 70]
endTime = [20, 40, 60, 80]
k = 1

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxFreeTime(eventTime, k, startTime, endTime))  # Output: 30
