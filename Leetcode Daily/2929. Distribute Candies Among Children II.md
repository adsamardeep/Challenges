# Distribute Candies with Constraints

## Problem Description

Given `n` candies and three children, determine how many ways you can distribute all the candies such that each child receives between `0` and `limit` candies (inclusive). Each distribution must satisfy:

- The total number of candies distributed is exactly `n`
- No child receives more than `limit` candies

This is a variation of the classic "integer partition" problem with upper bounds on each variable.

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:
        def H3(n):
            return 0 if n < 0 else (n + 2) * (n + 1) // 2
        return H3(n) - 3 * H3(n - limit - 1) + 3 * H3(n - 2 * (limit + 1)) - H3(n - 3 * (limit + 1))
