# 🏷 Count permutations where the first element is strictly the smallest

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given a list `x` of integers, return the number of permutations of the list that keep `x[0]` fixed in the first position **only if** `x[0]` is strictly smaller than every other element in `x`. If `x[0]` is not strictly the smallest (including if any other element equals it), return `0`. The result should be given modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:** `x = [1, 3, 2]`  
**Output:** `2`  
(Explanation: `x[0]=1` is strictly smaller than the others, so the remaining 2 elements can be arranged in `2! = 2` ways.)

**Input:** `x = [2, 1, 2]`  
**Output:** `0`  
(Explanation: `x[0]=2` is not strictly smaller than every other element — there's another `2` — so result is `0`.)

**Input:** `x = [5]`  
**Output:** `1`  
(Explanation: Single-element list — one valid permutation.)

## 🧠 Approach
1. Handle trivial/edge cases first:
   - If the list is empty, return `0` (undefined/none to permute).
   - If the list has a single element, return `1`.
2. For length >= 2, check whether `x[0]` is strictly smaller than `min(x[1:])`.
   - If not strictly smaller (i.e., `x[0] >= min(x[1:])`), return `0`.
   - Otherwise, the number of permutations that keep `x[0]` fixed is the number of permutations of the remaining `n-1` items: `(n-1)!`.
3. Compute factorial modulo `10**9 + 7` to keep results within bounds.

## 💻 Code 
```python
from typing import List
from math import factorial

class Solution:
    def countPermutations(self, x: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = len(x)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        # if first element is not strictly smaller than every other element, no valid permutations
        if x[0] >= min(x[1:]):
            return 0
        return factorial(n - 1) % MOD

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity: O(n) — dominated by `min(x[1:])` which scans the remaining `n-1` elements once.
* Space complexity: O(1) extra space (ignoring input storage), since only a few variables are used.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Empty list `[]`: returns `0` (no meaningful permutation with a fixed first element).
* Single-element list `[a]`: returns `1` (only one permutation).
* Duplicate values equal to `x[0]` present in `x[1:]`: returns `0` because `x[0]` is not strictly smaller.
* Negative numbers and zeros: handled normally by comparisons.
* Large `n`: factorial grows fast — result is reduced modulo `10^9 + 7`.
