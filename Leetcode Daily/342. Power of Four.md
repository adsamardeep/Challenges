# 🔢 Problem: Power of Four

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, determine whether it is a **power of four**.

A number is a power of four if:
- It can be written as `4^x` where `x` is a non-negative integer.
- Examples: `1, 4, 16, 64, 256, ...`

---

## 🔍 Example 1
**Input**
```python
n = 16
```
**Explanation**
- `16 = 4^2`
- It is a power of four.

**Output**
```
True
```

---

## 🔍 Example 2
**Input**
```python
n = 8
```
**Explanation**
- `8 = 2^3` — not a power of four.

**Output**
```
False
```

---

## 🧠 Approach
We use **bit manipulation** to check:
1. `n > 0` → must be positive.
2. `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` → ensures `n` is a power of two (only one bit set).
3. `(n & 0x55555555) != 0` → ensures that the set bit is at an **even position**, which is true only for powers of four.
   - `0x55555555` in binary is `010101010101...`, masking bits in even positions.

## 💻 Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0 and (n & 0x55555555) != 0
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) — constant time checks.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — no extra space used.

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- `n = 0` → `False`
- `n = 1` → `True` (4⁰)
- Large numbers like `1073741824 (4^15)` → `True`
- Odd numbers → always `False`
