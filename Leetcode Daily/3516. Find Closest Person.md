# 🟩 Problem: Find Closest Number to Target

## 📜 Problem Statement
You are given three integers:  
- `x`  
- `y`  
- `z` (target)  

Return:
- `1` if `x` is closer to `z` than `y`.  
- `2` if `y` is closer to `z` than `x`.  
- `0` if both are equally close to `z`.  

---

## 🔍 Example

Input:  
    x = 5, y = 10, z = 7  

Process:  
- Distance of x from z = |5 - 7| = 2  
- Distance of y from z = |10 - 7| = 3  
- Since 2 < 3, x is closer.  

Output:  
    1

## 🧠 Approach
1. Compute absolute difference between `x` and `z` → `diff1`.  
2. Compute absolute difference between `y` and `z` → `diff2`.  
3. Compare `diff1` and `diff2`:  
   - If `diff1 < diff2`, return 1.  
   - If `diff2 < diff1`, return 2.  
   - Otherwise, return 0 (equal distance).

    class Solution:
        def findClosest(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
            diff1 = abs(x - z)
            diff2 = abs(y - z)

            if diff1 < diff2:
                return 1
            elif diff2 < diff1:
                return 2
            else:
                return 0

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) (constant-time arithmetic).  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).  

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- `x = z` and `y != z` → should return `1`.  
- `y = z` and `x != z` → should return `2`.  
- Both equally distant → should return `0`.  
- Negative numbers also work since absolute difference handles them.
