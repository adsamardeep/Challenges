# ðŸŽ¯ Maximum Value of Attending Events with at Most k Events

This Python implementation solves the problem of finding the **maximum total value** of attending up to `k` non-overlapping events. Each event has a start day, end day, and associated value. The goal is to pick the optimal subset of at most `k` events such that no events overlap and the total value is maximized.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Overview

You are given a list of `events`, where each event is represented as `[start, end, value]`. You can attend at most `k` events, but you cannot attend overlapping events (i.e., their date ranges must not intersect). Your task is to return the **maximum value** you can accumulate by choosing the best possible set of non-overlapping events.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Uses **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with memoization
- Utilizes **binary search** (`bisect_right`) to optimize event lookups
- Efficient solution for large inputs
- Handles edge cases like zero overlap or k > n

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Sort** the events by their end time.
2. Maintain a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
   - `i` is the index of the first `i` events considered.
   - `j` is the number of events selected so far (up to `k`).
3. For each event:
   - Use **binary search** to find the latest non-overlapping event.
   - Choose the best between skipping the current event or including it and adding its value to the best prior solution.
4. Return `dp[n][k]` as the result.

## ðŸ’» Code Usage

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

class Solution:
    def maxValue(self, events, k):
        events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        n = len(events)
        start_times = [e[0] for e in events]
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            start, end, value = events[i - 1]
            prev = self.findLastNonOverlapping(events, i - 1, start)

            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[prev + 1][j - 1] + value)

        return dp[n][k]

    def findLastNonOverlapping(self, events, right, targetStart):
        left = 0
        res = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if events[mid][1] < targetStart:
                res = mid
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return res

# Example usage:
events = [[1, 3, 4], [2, 5, 2], [4, 6, 4], [6, 7, 3]]
k = 2
sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxValue(events, k))  # Output: 7
