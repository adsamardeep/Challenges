# Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph

## Problem Description

You are given:
- A directed graph with `n` nodes (0-indexed),
- A string `colors` of length `n` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i`th node,
- A list of `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates a directed edge from node `u` to node `v`.

Your task is to return the **maximum number of occurrences of any single color along any valid path** in the graph. If the graph contains a cycle, return `-1`.

### Example:

```
Input:
colors = "abaca"
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

Output:
3

Explanation:
- The path 0 → 2 → 3 → 4 has the color sequence "acca".
- The color 'a' appears 3 times.
```

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestPathValue(self, colors: str, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(colors)
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        indegree = [0] * n

        for u, v in edges:
            adj[u].append(v)
            indegree[v] += 1

        dp = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()

        for i in range(n):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
            dp[i][ord(colors[i]) - ord('a')] = 1

        visited = 0
        maxColor = 0

        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            visited += 1

            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                for c in range(26):
                    inc = 1 if ord(colors[neighbor]) - ord('a') == c else 0
                    dp[neighbor][c] = max(dp[neighbor][c], dp[node][c] + inc)

                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

            maxColor = max(maxColor, max(dp[node]))

        return maxColor if visited == n else -1
```

## Notes

- **Topological Sorting** is used to process the graph in valid order and detect cycles.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** matrix `dp[i][c]` holds the max count of color `c` on any path ending at node `i`.
- If not all nodes are visited, a **cycle exists**, and `-1` is returned.
- Time Complexity: O(n + e * 26), where `e` is the number of edges.
- Space Complexity: O(n * 26)

This approach ensures that the color counts are accurately propagated across valid paths in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
