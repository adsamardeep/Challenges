# 🏋️‍♂️ Match Players with Trainers

This repository contains a Python implementation of a greedy algorithm that matches players with trainers based on their abilities and capacities. The goal is to **maximize the number of valid player-trainer pairings**, where each trainer can only train one player if their capacity is at least equal to the player's ability.

---

## 📘 Problem Overview

You are given:
- A list `players[]`, where each element is a player's ability.
- A list `trainers[]`, where each element is a trainer's capacity.

### Objective:
Match as many players with trainers as possible such that:
- Each player is matched to **at most one trainer**.
- A player can be matched to a trainer only if `player[i] <= trainer[j]`.

Return the **maximum number of matches**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses a **greedy two-pointer technique** for efficient matching
- Handles edge cases such as empty player or trainer lists
- Efficient for large input sizes (linear scan after sorting)

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Strategy

1. **Sort** both `players` and `trainers` in non-decreasing order.
2. Use two pointers (`i` for players, `j` for trainers) to iterate.
3. For each player:
   - If the current trainer can train the player, move both pointers forward and count the match.
   - Otherwise, try the next trainer.
4. Stop when either list is fully traversed.

This ensures optimal matching by always giving a player the smallest available trainer who can handle them.

## 💻 Code Example

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def matchPlayersAndTrainers(self, players: List[int], trainers: List[int]) -> int:
        players.sort()
        trainers.sort()
        i = j = count = 0
        while i < len(players) and j < len(trainers):
            if players[i] <= trainers[j]:
                i += 1
                count += 1
            j += 1
        return count

# Example usage
players = [4, 7, 9]
trainers = [8, 2, 5, 8]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.matchPlayersAndTrainers(players, trainers))  # Output: 3
