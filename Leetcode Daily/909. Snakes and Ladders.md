# Snakes and Ladders

## Problem Description

You are given a `n x n` board representing the game of Snakes and Ladders. Each cell can either be:

- `-1`: A regular square, or  
- A **destination cell** indicating a ladder or a snake that moves you to that square (1-indexed).

The board is filled from bottom-left to top-right in a zigzag pattern.

Your task is to determine the **minimum number of moves** required to reach the final square (`n * n`) starting from square `1`, by simulating a fair 6-sided dice. If it's not possible to reach the end, return `-1`.

### Example:

```
Input:
board = [
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]
]

Output: 4
```

## Python Solution

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(board)
        flatten = [0] * (n * n)

        # Flatten the board based on zigzag pattern
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -2):
            for j in range(n):
                flatten[(n - 1 - i) * n + j] = board[i][j] - 1
                if i >= 1:
                    flatten[(n - i) * n + (n - 1 - j)] = board[i - 1][j] - 1

        visited = [-1] * (n * n)
        q = deque()
        q.append(0)
        visited[0] = 0

        while q:
            curr = q.popleft()
            if curr == n * n - 1:
                return visited[curr]

            for i in range(1, min(6, n * n - 1 - curr) + 1):
                next_pos = curr + i
                if flatten[next_pos] != -2:
                    next_pos = flatten[next_pos]
                if visited[next_pos] != -1:
                    continue
                visited[next_pos] = visited[curr] + 1
                q.append(next_pos)

        return -1
```

## Notes

- The board is flattened into a 1D array following the game's zigzag numbering.
- The BFS algorithm is used to find the shortest path from square `1` to square `n * n`.
- Ladders and snakes are handled by redirecting the move destination to the target cell.
- If the target cannot be reached, the function returns `-1`.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n²), as each square is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n²), due to the flattened board and visited array.

This solution guarantees the shortest number of moves using BFS traversal in a game-theoretic setting.
