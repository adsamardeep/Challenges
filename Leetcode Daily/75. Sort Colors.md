# Sort Colors

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, represented by integers `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red (0), white (1), and blue (2).

You must solve this problem without using the built-in sort function and with constant extra space.

### Example:

Input: nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]  
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

## Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        zero = one = two = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == 0:
                zero += 1
            elif n == 1:
                one += 1
            else:
                two += 1

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if zero > 0:
                nums[i] = 0
                zero -= 1
            elif one > 0:
                nums[i] = 1
                one -= 1
            else:
                nums[i] = 2
                two -= 1
```
