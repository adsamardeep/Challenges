# 🏷 Maximum Matrix Sum After Sign Flips

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given a matrix of integers, you may flip the sign of any element any number of times. Return the **maximum possible sum** of the matrix after applying optimal sign flips.

## 🔍 Example Input/Output
**Input:**
```python
matrix = [[1, -2, 3], [-4, 5, -6]]
````

**Output:**

```python
21
```

**Explanation:**
Flip `-2`, `-4`, and `-6` to positive. All values become positive, yielding the maximum sum.

## 🧠 Approach

1. Traverse all elements in the matrix.
2. Accumulate the sum of **absolute values** of all elements.
3. Track:

   * `minAbs`: the minimum absolute value in the matrix.
   * `negOdd`: whether the count of negative numbers is odd.
4. If the number of negatives is **odd**, one element must remain negative after flips.

   * To minimize the penalty, subtract `2 * minAbs` from the total sum.
5. Return the adjusted sum.

This works because flipping signs is free, and only the **parity** of negative numbers matters.

## 💻 Code 

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxMatrixSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        sum, minAbs = 0, inf
        negOdd = False

        for row in matrix:
            for x in row:
                minAbs = min(minAbs, abs(x))
                if x < 0:
                    sum -= x
                    negOdd = 1 - negOdd
                else:
                    sum += x

        return sum - 2 * negOdd * minAbs
```

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(m × n)`
  Every element is visited once.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  Only constant extra variables are used.

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* Matrix with all positive numbers
* Matrix with all negative numbers
* Odd number of negative values
* Presence of zero (can neutralize odd negative count)
* Single-element matrix
